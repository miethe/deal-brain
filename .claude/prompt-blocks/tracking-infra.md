Utilize subagents for every task. Remember your documentation guidance, with the ONLY tracking docs/artifacts being a single set created by ai-artifacts-engineer for the entire PRD. NO other docs/artifacts should be created if not explicitly outlined in the plan, NO reports, NO summaries, etc.

Specifically, the agent will create .claude/progress/{PRD-NAME}/all-phases-progress.md file, populating it with all tasks to be created across all phases of work for this implementation of the above PRD. Then, lead-architect will add notes to each task regarding which subagent(s) the task should be delegated to. The context file should be similar, created within similar dir in .claude/worknotes/{PRD-NAME}/all-phases-context.md, containing all relevant context for the entire PRD. Remember, this will be your worknotes for the entire PRD implementation, serving as a file-based context cache for all subagents working on the PRD since they won't share context, as well as across turns/phases.
