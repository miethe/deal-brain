Utilize subagents for every task. Remember your documentation guidance, with the ONLY tracking docs/artifacts being a single set created by ai-artifacts-engineer for the entire PRD. NO other docs/artifacts should be created if not explicitly outlined in the plan, NO reports, NO summaries, etc.

Specifically, the agent will create .claude/progress/{PRD-NAME}/all-phases-progress.md file, populating it with all tasks to be created across all phases of work for this implementation of the above PRD. Then, lead-architect will add notes to each task regarding which subagent(s) the task should be delegated to. The context file should be similar, created within similar dir in .claude/worknotes/{PRD-NAME}/all-phases-context.md, containing any relevant context for the entire PRD which arises during development. Remember, this is NOT to mirror the plan or PRD, but rather any notes which arise during dev, serving as a file-based context cache for all subagents working on the PRD since they won't share context, as well as across turns/phases.

You should NOT load the entire context file at once, just keeping it updated with current status at the end of each turn, reviewing the latest section for current status, or if a question arises about prior context.
