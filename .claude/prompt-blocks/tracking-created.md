Utilize subagents for every task. Remember your documentation guidance, with the ONLY tracking docs/artifacts already created for the entire PRD. NO other docs/artifacts should be created if not explicitly outlined in the plan, NO reports, NO summaries, etc. You MAY keep very brief observation notes within a running log in .claude/worknotes/observations/ regarding any key points that might arise during implementation, generally unrelated to the PRD tasks themselves.

Specifically, the agent has created .claude/progress/{PRD-NAME}/all-phases-progress.md file and populated it with all tasks along with notes per task regarding which subagent(s) the task should be delegated to. There is also a context file in .claude/worknotes/{PRD-NAME}/all-phases-context.md, containing all relevant context for the entire PRD. Remember, this will be your worknotes for the entire PRD implementation, serving as a file-based context cache for all subagents working on the PRD since they won't share context, as well as across turns/phases. You should NOT load the entire context file at once, just keeping it updated with current status at the end of each turn, reviewing the latest section for current status, or if a question arises about prior context.
