# Session: Listings Facelift V2 Planning

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Type:** Planning & Documentation
**Duration:** ~2 hours

---

## Summary

Created comprehensive planning documentation for Listings Facelift Enhancements V2 project. Analyzed current codebase state, created PRD, implementation plan, and tracking documents.

---

## Key Actions Taken

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Reviewed current listings components (modal, detail page, specifications tab)
   - Verified existing tooltip implementation (recently refactored to Popover pattern)
   - Confirmed valuation breakdown API endpoint structure
   - Identified missing entity catalog pages (404 errors)

2. **PRD Creation**
   - Documented 7 feature requirements with detailed acceptance criteria
   - Defined success metrics and timeline (4 weeks, 4 phases)
   - Created user stories for each epic
   - Outlined technical constraints and dependencies

3. **Implementation Plan Creation**
   - Broke down work into 24 discrete tasks across 4 phases
   - Provided code snippets and file paths for each task
   - Estimated effort (S/M/L/XL) and identified dependencies
   - Highlighted risks and mitigation strategies

4. **Progress Tracking Setup**
   - Created tracking document with task checklists
   - Set up phase-based progress monitoring
   - Defined success metrics dashboard
   - Established activity log format

## Key Findings

### Current State
- **Overview Modal:** Mostly complete, needs product image and minor enhancements
- **Detail Page:** Has working tooltips but needs layout optimization
- **Specifications Tab:** Exists but lacks subsection organization
- **Valuation Tab:** Backend ready (includes inactive rules), frontend needs update
- **Entity Pages:** Completely missing (404 errors)

### Technical Debt Identified
- Entity catalog routes don't exist (`/catalog/cpus/{id}`, etc.)
- Backend entity detail endpoints may need creation/verification
- No fallback image assets for product images

### Architectural Notes
- Frontend: Next.js 14 App Router, React Query for state
- Backend: FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy
- UI: shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS
- Recently refactored EntityTooltip to use Popover pattern (working correctly)

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Phased Approach:** 4 phases aligned with PRD timeline
2. **Foundation First:** Start with quick wins (GPU display, URL links, tooltips, valuation rules)
3. **Backend Priority:** Verify entity endpoints early in Phase 3 to unblock frontend work
4. **Image Fallback Hierarchy:** 5 levels (listing > manufacturer > CPU logo > form factor > generic)
5. **Specifications Organization:** 4 subsections (Compute, Memory, Storage, Connectivity)

---

## Risks Identified

1. **High Risk:** Backend entity endpoints may not exist
   - Mitigation: Complete endpoint verification (TASK-012) early in Phase 3

2. **Medium Risk:** Image loading may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Use Next.js Image optimization, lazy loading

3. **Medium Risk:** Quick-add dialogs increase complexity
   - Mitigation: Start simple, iterate based on feedback

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. Start with TASK-001 (GPU Display Enhancement) - easiest task
3. Work through Foundation tasks sequentially
4. Complete Phase 1 before moving to Phase 2

## Files Created

- `docs/project_plans/listings-facelift-enhancement/prd-listings-facelift-v2.md`
- `docs/project_plans/listings-facelift-enhancement/implementation-plan-v2.md`
- `.claude/progress/listings-facelift-v2-progress.md`
- `.claude/worknotes/2025-10-26-listings-facelift-v2-planning.md` (this file)

---

## Related Context

- Original requirements: `listings-facelift-enhancements-v2.md`
- Recent tooltip work: Fixed EntityTooltip to use Popover pattern (was incorrectly using `/listings/entities/...` endpoints)
- Current branch: `feat/listings-facelift`

---

## Learnings

1. **Documentation-Writer Agent:** Hit token limit when trying to create large documents via subagent. Solution: Create documents directly with Write tool.

2. **Current Architecture Quality:** Existing code is well-structured with good separation of concerns. Tooltip system is robust after recent refactor.

3. **Entity Pages Gap:** No entity catalog pages exist - this is the biggest missing piece causing 404 errors throughout the app.

4. **Backend API Ready:** Valuation breakdown endpoint already returns inactive rules (since lines 437-462 in listings.py), so no backend changes needed for FR-6.

## Questions for Later

1. Do backend entity detail endpoints exist? Need to verify in Phase 3.
2. Where should fallback images be sourced? Need design assets.
3. Should quick-add dialogs update via PATCH or redirect to full edit page?
4. What benchmark data should display on entity catalog pages?
