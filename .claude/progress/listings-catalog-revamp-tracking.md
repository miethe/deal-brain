## Notes & Decisions

### Architectural Decisions:
- Using Zustand for client state management (lightweight, minimal boilerplate)
- React Query handles server state (already integrated)
- Client-side filtering for initial implementation (<1000 listings)
- Virtual scrolling deferred to Phase 3 (Dense List View)
- URL state synchronization with 300ms debounce to avoid history pollution

### Dependencies:
- zustand (already installed v5.0.8)
- @radix-ui/react-tabs (added to package.json, needs install)
- Existing: shadcn/ui, lucide-react, @tanstack/react-query
- All other dependencies already in place

### Key Learnings:
- Zustand persist middleware only stores specified fields (partialize)
- useDebounce hook from use-debounce works well for search inputs
- Next.js router.replace() with scroll:false prevents jumps during URL updates
- Tab components need proper ARIA attributes from Radix UI for accessibility
