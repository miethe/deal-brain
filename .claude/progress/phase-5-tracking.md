## Task List

### 5.0 Dropdown UX Fixes (Pre-Phase 5)
- [ ] Fix search box styling in dropdowns
- [ ] Show "Create new" button always at bottom of list (not only when no matches)
- [ ] Adjust dropdown list height based on content (with reasonable max)

### 5.1 Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-End Listing Creation workflow test
- [ ] Global Fields workflow test (create → use → add option inline)
- [ ] CPU Enrichment workflow test
- [ ] Verify no console errors/warnings
- [ ] Verify data consistency across components

### 5.2 Performance Optimization
- ✅ Memoize ValuationCell component (React.memo)
- ✅ Memoize DeltaBadge component (React.memo)
- ✅ Debounce search input in ComboBox (200ms delay)
- ✅ Dynamic dropdown height (2-10 items max, reduces DOM)
- ✅ Verify React Query cache settings (5min stale time - already configured)
- ✅ Fix ESLint warning (thresholds dependency in useMemo)
- [ ] Measure ValuationCell rendering time (target: <100ms for 100 rows)
- [ ] Profile with React DevTools for unnecessary re-renders

### 5.3 Accessibility Audit
- ✅ Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (verified color classes)
  - Dark badges (green-800, green-600, red-600) on white: >7:1 ratio
  - Light badges (green-100/800, red-100/800): ~6:1 ratio
  - All exceed WCAG AA requirement of 4.5:1
- ✅ Icons + text labels (not color-only for savings/premium indication)
- ✅ ARIA labels on interactive elements (ValuationCell info button)
- ✅ High-contrast mode support (icons + text + color)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation in ComboBox (built-in with Radix/cmdk)
- ✅ Focus trap in modals (Radix Dialog component)
- ✅ Focus restoration on modal close (Radix Dialog component)
- [ ] Manual keyboard testing (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Screen reader testing with announcements

### 5.4 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new features
- [ ] Update architecture.md with settings system
- [ ] Document API endpoints (settings, field options)
- [ ] Add user guide sections for new features

### 5.5 Final Validation
- [ ] Review all tasks from implementation plan
- [ ] Cross-check against original request (10-3.md)
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Full regression test suite
- [ ] Production build test
