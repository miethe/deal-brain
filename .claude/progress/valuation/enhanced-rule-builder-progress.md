# Enhanced Rule Builder - Implementation Progress

**Started:** 2025-10-03
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation (Week 1-2)

## Phase 1: Foundation Tasks

### Backend Tasks
- [x] Task 1.1: Create Field Metadata Service
  - Created `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/field_metadata.py`
  - Defined FieldMetadata, EntityMetadata, OperatorDefinition dataclasses
  - Implemented FieldMetadataService with 12 operators
  - Integrated with existing FieldRegistry for listing fields
  - Added CPU and GPU entity metadata
- [x] Task 1.2: Create API Endpoint for Entity Metadata
  - Created `apps/api/dealbrain_api/api/entities.py`
  - Added GET /entities/metadata endpoint
  - Returns entities, fields, and operators in structured format
  - Registered router in api/__init__.py
- [x] Task 1.3: Enhance Rule Preview Service
  - Verified existing RulePreviewService implementation
  - Confirmed preview_rule method exists with condition/action evaluation
  - Service already provides statistics and sample listing results
- [x] Task 1.4: Create API Endpoint for Rule Preview
  - Confirmed POST /valuation-rules/preview endpoint exists
  - RulePreviewResponse schema already defined
  - Endpoint functional and ready to use
- [ ] Task 1.5: Write tests for backend services

### Frontend Tasks
- [x] Task 1.6: Create Entity/Field Selector Component
  - Created `apps/web/components/valuation/entity-field-selector.tsx`
  - Implements searchable popover with entity grouping
  - Shows field descriptions and supports custom fields
  - React Query caching with 5-minute stale time
- [x] Task 1.7: Create Polymorphic Value Input Component
  - Created `apps/web/components/valuation/value-input.tsx`
  - Adapts input type based on field data type
  - Supports string, number, enum, boolean, multi-value
  - Enum fields render as Select dropdowns
- [x] Task 1.8: Create Basic Preview Panel
  - Created `apps/web/components/valuation/rule-preview-panel.tsx`
  - Shows matched count, avg adjustment, total listings
  - Displays sample matched listings with before/after
  - Green/red badges for adjustment direction
- [x] Task 1.9: Create API Client Functions
  - Created `apps/web/lib/api/entities.ts`
  - Defined TypeScript interfaces for entities metadata
  - Implemented fetchEntitiesMetadata function
- [x] Task 1.10: Create Command Component
  - Created `apps/web/components/ui/command.tsx`
  - Full cmdk wrapper with all sub-components
  - Needed for EntityFieldSelector popover
- [ ] Task 1.11: Integrate components into RuleBuilderModal

### Phase 1 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/api/entities/metadata` endpoint returns all entities with fields
- [ ] `/api/rules/preview` endpoint evaluates conditions and returns statistics
- [ ] `EntityFieldSelector` component displays searchable field list
- [ ] `ValueInput` component adapts to field type
- [ ] `RulePreviewPanel` displays matched listings count and average adjustment
- [ ] React Query caches metadata for 5 minutes
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >80% coverage

## Phase 2: Advanced Logic Tasks

### Backend Tasks
- [x] Task 2.1: Create Rule Evaluator for Nested Conditions
  - Created `packages/core/dealbrain_core/rule_evaluator.py`
  - Implemented ConditionNode class with recursive evaluation
  - Supports dot notation for nested field access (e.g., "listing.cpu.cpu_mark_multi")
  - Handles all 12 operators with null-safe comparisons
  - Supports AND/OR logical operators for condition groups
- [x] Task 2.2: Verify Database Models
  - Confirmed `parent_condition_id` already exists in ValuationCondition model
  - Database supports hierarchical condition structure
- [ ] Task 2.3: Enhance Rule Preview Service for Condition Details
  - Needs integration with new ConditionNode evaluator

### Frontend Tasks
- [x] Task 2.4: Create Condition Group Component
  - Created `apps/web/components/valuation/condition-group.tsx`
  - Supports nested condition groups up to 2 levels deep
  - AND/OR logical operator toggle with visual badge
  - Visual indentation based on nesting depth (depth * 24px)
  - Add condition and add group buttons
- [x] Task 2.5: Create Condition Row Component
  - Created `apps/web/components/valuation/condition-row.tsx`
  - Uses EntityFieldSelector for field selection
  - Operator dropdown filtered by field type
  - Polymorphic ValueInput adapts to field data type
  - Remove button for deleting condition
- [x] Task 2.6: Add Drag-and-Drop to Condition Group
  - Installed @dnd-kit/core and @dnd-kit/sortable
  - Implemented SortableCondition wrapper component
  - DndContext with keyboard and pointer sensors
  - handleDragEnd uses arrayMove for reordering
  - Visual opacity feedback during drag (0.5)
- [x] Task 2.7: Add Condition Multipliers to Action Builder
  - Created `apps/web/components/valuation/action-builder.tsx`
  - 5 action types: fixed_value, per_unit, percentage, benchmark_based, formula
  - Condition multipliers for new (1.0), refurb (0.75), used (0.6)
  - Formula action type with textarea input
  - Grid layout for multiplier inputs with min/max validation
- [x] Task 2.8: Integrate advanced components into RuleBuilderModal
  - Replaced simple condition builder with ConditionGroup
  - Replaced simple action builder with ActionBuilder
  - Cleaned up unused handler functions
  - Removed duplicate constants (OPERATORS, ACTION_TYPES)

### Phase 2 Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Condition groups support nesting (UI limits to 2 levels)
- [x] Drag-and-drop reordering works for conditions within same group
- [x] AND/OR toggle updates all conditions in group
- [x] Action builder includes condition multiplier inputs
- [x] Custom fields from `FieldRegistry` appear in entity selector
- [ ] Nested conditions save correctly to database with `parent_condition_id`
  - Database model supports it, needs backend service integration
- [ ] Preview evaluates nested logic correctly
  - ConditionNode evaluator exists, needs integration with preview service
- [ ] All unit and integration tests pass
  - Tests not yet written

## Notes
- Building on existing rule builder at `apps/web/components/valuation/rule-builder-modal.tsx`
- Backend services at `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/`
- API routes at `apps/api/dealbrain_api/api/`
- Using existing database schema with `parent_condition_id` support
