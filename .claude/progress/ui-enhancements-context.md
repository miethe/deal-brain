## Current Phase: Phase 7 Complete ✅
Focus: Multi-Pane Layout & Static Navigation

### 2025-10-11 — RAM & Storage Valuation Modernization Kickoff
- Captured PRD/implementation plan for catalog-driven RAM/storage valuation under `docs/project_plans/enhancements/2025-10-11-ram-storage-valuation/`.
- Established task tracker `.claude/progress/ram-storage-valuation-progress.md` to guide backend catalog APIs, importer/seed updates, frontend selectors, valuation builder upgrades, telemetry, and documentation.
- No migrations planned per guidance; focus on leveraging existing schema (`ram_spec`, `storage_profile`) with enhanced services and UI.
- Delivered catalog endpoints (`/v1/catalog/ram-specs`, `/v1/catalog/storage-profiles`), shared normalization helpers, importer updates, and canonical seed data for RAM/storage profiles.
- Added reusable selectors with inline creation + analytics, wired them into listing creation and inline editing, and exposed `ram_spec` / `storage.*` fields to the valuation rule builder.

### 2025-10-10 — Valuation Rules Remediation Planning
- Reviewed request log `docs/project_plans/requests/10-10.md` to map rule-engine regressions in listings valuation.
- Noted Celery task signature drift (`enqueue_listing_recalculation` vs `recalculate_listings_task`) blocking rule updates.
- Captured UI gaps: per-unit action builder lacks metric selector; ruleset toggle state not persisting or visually contained.
- Lesson: keep task payload parity and UX controls aligned with backend capabilities to surface valuation adjustments.
- Synced Celery task signatures and added valuation logging + regression tests with Celery stubs to keep recalculation stable in dev.
- Added canonical per-unit metric selector with reusable options, backend validation, and service-level guardrails.
- Stabilized listing override baseline handling, refreshed select layout, and covered reset flow with a React Testing Library spec.

### 2025-10-11 — RAM/Storage Valuation Foundation
- Landed Alembic migration `0017` to introduce normalized `ram_spec` and `storage_profile` tables, link them to listings, and backfill existing rows from legacy RAM/storage fields.
- Extended listing services and seeds to auto-resolve specs and profiles on create/update flows, exposing `ram_type`, `ram_speed_mhz`, and profile references through FieldRegistry.
- Enriched rule evaluation context and action metrics with RAM speed/capacity plus primary/secondary storage profile quantities for spec-based valuation rules.
- Updated web types, listing detail surfaces, comparison views, and add-listing workflow to surface structured RAM/storage summaries and accept RAM spec inputs out of the box.

### 2025-10-12 — Baseline Valuation Implementation (Workstream 1 Complete)
- Reviewed basic valuation PRD and architecture references, created implementation roadmap
- **Completed Workstream 1: Data Modeling & Baseline Ingestion**
  - Added `metadata_json` JSONB column to `valuation_rule_group` with `entity_key` index (migration 0018)
  - Implemented `BaselineLoaderService` with hash-based idempotency for JSON→rules mapping
  - Created CLI command (`python -m dealbrain_api.cli baselines load`) and Celery task for ingestion
  - Fixed circular import in tasks module using lazy imports
  - Fixed SQLAlchemy JSONB query syntax (cast to String for comparisons)
  - Created comprehensive sample baseline JSON (6 entities, 12 field definitions)
  - Written 3 unit tests for baseline loader (95%+ coverage target)
  - **Known Issue**: Recalculation task fails without Redis; baseline creation succeeds but triggers event loop error
  - **Next**: Fix recalculation task to gracefully handle missing Redis, then proceed to Workstream 2 (Evaluation Precedence)

### 2025-10-14 — React Warnings & UI Fixes
- **Issue**: Nested button DOM validation warning in baseline field card tooltips
- **Root Cause**: Radix UI `TooltipTrigger` with `asChild` prop requires proper interactive element, was wrapping icon directly
- **Resolution**: Wrapped `Info` icon in `<button>` element with proper accessibility attributes
  - Added `type="button"` to prevent form submission
  - Added `aria-label="Field explanation"` for screen readers
  - Maintained inline display with CSS class
- **Files Modified**: `apps/web/components/valuation/baseline-field-card.tsx`

## Gap Analysis Findings (10-2-2025)

After comprehensive review of PRD, Implementation Plan, and completed phases, the following gaps were identified:

### Critical Missing Features:
1. **RAM/Storage Dropdowns** - Requested in original 10-2-2.md but never implemented
   - RAM (GB) should be dropdown with common values (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128)
   - Primary Storage (GB) should be dropdown with common values (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096)
   - Phase 2.3 notes claim this was done, but listings-table.tsx shows it was NOT implemented
   - Currently only Storage Type has dropdown, RAM and Storage are plain text inputs

2. **Column Width Text Wrapping** - Requested but not fully implemented
   - Listings Title column and other non-long-text fields should never truncate
   - Should wrap text and/or enforce minimum width per field
   - Currently text can be cut off when resizing columns
   - Phase 2.1 notes mention min width constraints but not implemented in listings table

3. **Inline Dropdown Option Creation** - Partially implemented
   - Phase 2.3 claims ComboBox with inline creation, but EditableCell uses plain select
   - No "Create new option" functionality when typing in dropdowns
   - Missing the confirmation dialog for adding new options
   - useFieldOptions hook may exist but not integrated into EditableCell

4. **Modal Styling** - Visual consistency issues
   - RuleBuilderModal has DialogContent with max-w-3xl but no proper internal padding structure
   - Needs consistent padding/margin treatment like other modals
   - Form sections should have proper spacing

### Implementation Status:
- Phase 1-2: ⚠️ Claimed complete but missing dropdown functionality
- Phase 3: ✅ Complete (Backend APIs)
- Phase 4: ✅ Complete (Global Fields UI)
- Phase 5: ⚠️ Claimed complete but modal styling needs work
- Phase 6: ✅ Complete (Listings Valuation Column)
- Phase 7: ✅ Complete (Multi-Pane Layout & Static Nav)

## Remediation Complete ✅ (10-2-2025)

All identified gaps have been successfully addressed and committed:

### Completed Remediation Tasks:
1. ✅ **Modal Styling Standardization**
   - All valuation rule modals now have consistent px-6 py-4 padding
   - Form content properly wrapped in containers
   - Professional, cohesive appearance across all dialogs

2. ✅ **Column Width Constraints**
   - Title column enforces 200px minimum width
   - Text wrapping enabled for Title column
   - Visual indicator (amber dashed border) when at constraint
   - Prevents text truncation on important fields

3. ✅ **ComboBox Integration**
   - Existing ComboBox component integrated into EditableCell
   - Works for all dropdown fields (enum, number with options)
   - Inline option creation with confirmation dialog
   - Auto-refresh after new option added

4. ✅ **RAM/Storage Dropdowns**
   - RAM (GB): 9 common values (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128)
   - Storage (GB): 6 common values (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096)
   - Both support custom values via inline creation
   - Confirmation dialog before adding to global fields

### Additional Fixes:
- Added forwardRef to Input component

7. Listing integration (valuation display)
8. Data flow diagrams (3 complete flows)
9. API endpoints (25+ endpoints documented)
10. Future enhancements roadmap

### Key Architecture Components

**Hierarchy Model:**
```
Ruleset (priority, is_active, conditions_json)
  └─ RuleGroup[] (category, display_order, weight)
      └─ Rule[] (evaluation_order, priority, is_active)
          ├─ Condition[] (nested, AND/OR logic)
          └─ Action[] (fixed_value, per_unit, formula)
```

**Core Services:**
- **RulesService:** CRUD operations, validation, cascade management
- **RuleEvaluationService:** Evaluate listings, apply rulesets, batch processing
- **RulePreviewService:** Statistical analysis, sample listings
- **RulesetPackagingService:** Import/export, conflict resolution
- **FieldMetadataService:** Entity/field metadata for rule builder

**Frontend Modes:**
- **Basic Mode:** Simplified UI (baseline/condition adjustments) → generates managed rules
- **Advanced Mode:** Full hierarchy visualization, inline editing, drag-and-drop

**Condition System:**
- 12 operators (equals, gt, lt, in, contains, regex, etc.)
- Nested groups with AND/OR logic
- Dot notation field access (e.g., `cpu.cores`, `ram_spec.speed_mhz`)

**Action System:**
- **fixed_value:** Constant adjustment (e.g., -$50)
- **per_unit:** Multiplied by metric (e.g., -$2.5 × ram_gb)
- **formula:** Custom expressions via FormulaEngine

### Rule Evaluation Flow

```
1. Fetch listing with related data (CPU, GPU, RAM, storage)
2. Build context dictionary (flattened listing + nested entities)
3. Select ruleset:
   - Use listing.ruleset_id if active
   - Match ruleset conditions against context
   - Else use default active ruleset
4. Fetch all active rules from rule groups (sorted by evaluation_order)
5. For each rule:
   - Evaluate conditions (ConditionGroup handles AND/OR)
   - If matched, execute actions (ActionEngine)
   - Aggregate adjustments
6. Calculate total_adjustment
7. Update listing.adjusted_price_usd and valuation_breakdown
8. Commit to database
```

### Data Flow Diagrams

**Documented Flows:**
1. **Rule Creation:** User → Frontend → RulesService → Database (with versioning/audit)
2. **Listing Valuation:** Listing Save → RuleEvaluationService → RuleEvaluator → Update Listing
3. **Rule Preview:** User → Frontend → RulePreviewService → Statistics/Samples

### Frontend Integration

**Page Structure:** `/valuation-rules`
- Mode Toggle (Basic/Advanced)
- Ruleset Selector + Stats
- Ruleset Settings (priority, conditions)
- Mode-specific content (BasicValuationForm or Advanced rule hierarchy)

**Listing Display:**
- **ValuationCell:** Color-coded adjusted price with delta badge
- **ValuationBreakdownModal:** Detailed rule-by-rule breakdown
- **Threshold Configuration:** Stored in ApplicationSettings

### Key Concepts Documented

1. **Rule Priority vs Evaluation Order:** Clarified distinction and usage
2. **Ruleset Conditions vs Rule Conditions:** Different purposes, automatic selection
3. **Adjustment Semantics:** Negative = deduction, positive = premium
4. **Version History:** Snapshots + audit logs for compliance
5. **Basic Mode Syncing:** Managed rules with `basic_managed` metadata flag

### API Endpoints (25+ Documented)

**Rulesets:** Create, list, get, update, delete (5 endpoints)
**Rule Groups:** Create, list, update, delete (4 endpoints)
**Rules:** Create, list, get, update, delete, duplicate (6 endpoints)
**Evaluation:** Preview, evaluate, apply (3 endpoints)
**Audit:** Audit log retrieval (1 endpoint)
**Packaging:** Export, import (2 endpoints)

### Future Enhancements Roadmap

**Planned Features:**
- Rule templates and bulk actions
- Conditional actions and rule dependencies
- A/B testing and ML-assisted tuning
- Rule scheduling (time-based activation)

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Redis caching for ruleset structures

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Common Issues Documented:**
- Rules not matching listings (field name/operator issues)
- Adjusted price not updating (active flags, disabled rulesets)
- Basic mode desync (manual edits in Advanced mode)
- Performance degradation (rule count optimization)

### Technical Insights

**Design Decisions:**
- **Nested Conditions:** `parent_condition_id` enables complex AND/OR trees
- **Ruleset Conditions:** Automatic ruleset selection based on context
- **Action Flexibility:** `modifiers_json` provides future extensibility
- **Soft Deletes:** Versioning captures historical states

**Context Building:**
- Flattens listing + related entities into single dict
- Supports nested field access for conditions
- Includes custom fields from `attributes_json`

### Key Learnings

## Field Mapping Analysis (2025-10-11)

### Overview
Comprehensive field mapping analysis completed across the entire Deal Brain stack to document all entity fields from Database → Backend → Frontend. Generated reference document at `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/docs/technical/core-fields-mapping.md`.

### Analysis Scope
**Entities Mapped (13 total):**
- **Core Entities:** Listing, CPU, GPU, RamSpec, StorageProfile, ListingComponent, PortsProfile, Port
- **Valuation System:** ValuationRuleset, ValuationRuleGroup, ValuationRuleV2, ValuationRuleCondition, ValuationRuleAction
- **Supporting:** Profile, ApplicationSettings, CustomFieldDefinition
- **Import/Export:** ImportSession
- **Enumerations:** Condition, ListingStatus, RamGeneration, StorageMedium, ComponentType, PortType

**Layers Analyzed:**
1. **Database:** SQLAlchemy models (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/models/core.py`)
2. **Backend:** Pydantic schemas (`packages/core/dealbrain_core/schemas/`)
3. **Frontend:** TypeScript types (`apps/web/types/`, `apps/web/lib/api/`)
4. **API:** JSON keys in HTTP requests/responses

### Key Findings

#### 1. Strengths (Field Consistency)
✅ **Excellent Consistency:**
- **Timestamp Pattern:** All entities use `TimestampMixin` with `created_at` and `updated_at`
- **Custom Fields Architecture:** Unified `attributes_json` pattern across 8 entities
- **Type Safety:** Strong typing in Python (Pydantic) and TypeScript
- **Relationship Handling:** Consistent nested object serialization (lazy joined relationships)
- **Enum Management:** Centralized enums in `dealbrain_core.enums`
- **JSON Field Naming:** Backend uses `*_json` suffix, API removes it (clean separation)

#### 2. Identified Discrepancies

**⚠️ Port Field Naming Inconsistency (High Priority)**
- **DB:** `type`, `count`, `spec_notes`
- **Frontend:** `port_type`, `quantity`, `version`/`notes`
- **Impact:** Requires mapping in API layer, potential confusion
- **Recommendation:** Standardize to `port_type`, `count`, `spec_notes` across all layers

**⚠️ ListingComponent `rule_id` Field (Medium Priority)**
- **Issue:** Field exists in Pydantic schema but NOT in SQLAlchemy model
- **Location:** `packages/core/dealbrain_core/schemas/listing.py`
- **Impact:** Field appears in API but cannot be persisted to database
- **Recommendation:** Either add `rule_id` column to DB or remove from schema

**⚠️ Performance Metrics Dual System (Low Priority)**
- **Legacy:** `dollar_per_cpu_mark`, `dollar_per_single_mark`
- **New:** `dollar_per_cpu_mark_single/multi` with `_adjusted` variants
- **Impact:** Potential confusion about which metrics to use
- **Recommendation:** Deprecate legacy metrics once new system fully validated
- **Status:** Coexistence is acceptable during transition

#### 3. Field Count Summary

| Entity | Total Fields | Computed | Relationships | Custom Fields |
|--------|--------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Listing | 65+ | 2 (ram_type, ram_speed_mhz) | 8 | ✓ |
| CPU | 15 | 0 | 1 | ✓ |
| GPU | 7 | 0 | 1 | ✓ |
| RamSpec | 9 | 0 | 1 | ✓ |
| StorageProfile | 10 | 0 | 2 | ✓ |
| ListingComponent | 8 | 0 | 1 | ✗ |
| PortsProfile | 5 | 0 | 2 | ✓ |
| Port | 6 | 0 | 1 | ✗ |
| ValuationRuleset | 11 | 0 | 2 | ✗ |
| ValuationRuleGroup | 10 | 0 | 2 | ✗ |
| ValuationRuleV2 | 11 | 0 | 4 | ✗ |
| Profile | 7 | 0 | 1 | ✗ |
| CustomFieldDefinition | 16 | 0 | 1 | ✗ |

**Total Core Fields Across Stack:** 180+ fields mapped

#### 4. Enumeration Consistency
✅ **All enums use lowercase values:**
- `Condition`: "new", "refurb", "used"
- `RamGeneration`: "ddr3", "ddr4", "ddr5", etc.
- `StorageMedium`: "nvme", "sata_ssd", "hdd", etc.
- Frontend handles display formatting (uppercase, proper casing)

#### 5. Relationship Patterns
✅ **Consistent nested object serialization:**
- `Listing.cpu` → API: `cpu: CpuRecord | null`
- `Listing.ram_spec` → API: `ram_spec: RamSpecRecord | null`
- `Listing.ports_profile` → API: `ports_profile: PortsProfileRecord | null`
- Pattern: SQLAlchemy `lazy="joined"` or `lazy="selectin"` → JSON nested objects

### Documentation Output

**Generated:** `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/docs/technical/core-fields-mapping.md`

**Content Sections:**
1. Overview & Mapping Key
2. Core Entities (detailed field tables)
3. Valuation System (rule engine fields)
4. Supporting Entities (profiles, settings, custom fields)
5. Import/Export Entities
6. Enumerations (complete reference)
7. Discrepancies & Notes (actionable findings)
8. Summary & Field Count

**Format:**
- Comprehensive markdown tables with 7 columns per entity
- Field Name | DB Column | Backend Type | Frontend Type | API Key | Description | Constraints
- Visual indicators: ✓ (consistent), ⚠ (different), ✗ (missing), → (computed)

### Architectural Insights

**Custom Fields Architecture:**
- Pattern: `attributes_json` (DB) → `attributes` (API)
- Supported entities: Listing, CPU, GPU, RamSpec, StorageProfile, PortsProfile
- Storage: PostgreSQL JSON column with default={}
- Flexibility: Allows dynamic fields without schema changes

**Computed Fields:**
- `Listing.ram_type` → Derived from `ram_spec.ddr_generation`
- `Listing.ram_speed_mhz` → Derived from `ram_spec.speed_mhz`
- Pattern: SQLAlchemy `@property` decorators, not stored in DB

**Performance Metrics Evolution:**
- Phase 1 (Legacy): `dollar_per_cpu_mark`, `dollar_per_single_mark`
- Phase 2 (Current): Dual metrics with base/adjusted variants
- All metrics nullable, computed by services layer

### Action Items (Recommended)

**High Priority:**
1. Standardize Port field naming across stack (Backend PR)
2. Resolve ListingComponent.rule_id inconsistency (Add to DB or remove from schema)

**Medium Priority:**
3. Document migration path from legacy to new performance metrics
4. Add field mapping validation tests (ensure DB ↔ API consistency)

**Low Priority:**
5. Consider adding computed field documentation to models
6. Evaluate if PassMark fields should be exposed in CPU API

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Port Field Naming:** Requires refactor across 4 layers (DB, Backend, API, Frontend)
2. **ListingComponent.rule_id:** Ghost field in schema without DB backing
3. **Dual Metrics System:** Transition period complexity
4. **PassMark Fields:** Exposed in DB/Backend but not in Frontend types

### Key Learnings

1. **Comprehensive mapping reveals subtle inconsistencies** that might be missed in code review
2. **Field naming standards should be enforced** across all layers from initial design
3. **Computed fields need explicit documentation** to avoid confusion with stored fields
4. **Migration periods benefit from explicit dual-system documentation**
5. **Type consistency across stack (Python ↔ TypeScript)** is excellent with Pydantic
6. **JSON field naming convention** (`*_json` in DB, clean name in API) works well
7. **Custom fields architecture** provides excellent extensibility without schema bloat

### Reference for Developers

**When Adding New Fields:**
1. Check `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/docs/technical/core-fields-mapping.md` for patterns
2. Ensure DB column name matches across all layers
3. Use `*_json` suffix for JSON columns in DB
4. Add to appropriate Pydantic schema (Create/Read)
5. Update TypeScript types in `apps/web/types/`
6. Test API serialization matches expected keys
7. Document if computed/derived field

**When Modifying Existing Fields:**
1. Check field mapping document for dependencies
2. Update all 4 layers: DB → Backend → API → Frontend
3. Consider backward compatibility
4. Update tests and documentation
5. Check for enum value changes

### Conclusion

The field mapping analysis reveals a **well-architected system with excellent consistency** in most areas. The identified discrepancies are minor and can be addressed incrementally. The custom fields architecture provides excellent flexibility, and the type safety across Python/TypeScript boundaries is exemplary.

**Status:** ✅ Analysis complete, actionable findings documented, reference guide ready for team use.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review findings with backend team
2. Prioritize Port field naming refactor
3. Resolve ListingComponent.rule_id inconsistency
4. Use field mapping doc as onboarding reference

## Bug Fixes and Remediation (2025-10-14)

### Critical Bug Fix: Valuation Calculation 300% Adjustment

**Issue Identified:**
Every listing showed a +300% adjustment from Baseline rules. When DDR Generation, Condition, and Release Year rules were active, each contributed approximately $300 (for a $300 listing), resulting in $900 total adjustment (300%).

**Root Cause:**
The multiplier action calculation in `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/packages/core/dealbrain_core/rules/actions.py` line 67 had a Python falsy value bug:
```python
# BUGGY CODE:
multiplier = (self.value_usd or 100.0) / 100.0
```

When `value_usd = 0.0` (placeholder baseline rules), `0.0 or 100.0` evaluates to `100.0` because `0.0` is falsy in Python. This resulted in a 1.0x multiplier being applied to the current adjusted price, adding the full price as an adjustment.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# FIXED CODE:
multiplier = (self.value_usd if self.value_usd is not None else 100.0) / 100.0
```

Using explicit `is not None` check distinguishes between:
- `value_usd = 0.0` → 0% multiplier (no adjustment) ✓
- `value_usd = None` → 100% default multiplier ✓

**Impact:**
- Baseline placeholder rules now correctly produce $0 adjustment
- Existing multiplier rules with configured values unaffected
- No data migration required

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/core/dealbrain_core/rules/actions.py` (line 67-68)

---

### Minor UI Fix: Duplicate Dollar Signs

**Issue Identified:**
Performance metric badges showed duplicate dollar signs: `$$0.150 /ST` instead of `$0.150 /ST`

**Root Cause:**
The `formatMetric()` function in `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/apps/web/app/listings/_components/grid-view/performance-badges.tsx` already adds the dollar sign, but the badge rendering added another one.

**Fix Applied:**
Removed the extra `$` prefix from lines 61, 73, 91, and 112:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
<Badge>${formatMetric(dollarPerSingleRaw)} /ST</Badge>

// AFTER:
<Badge>{formatMetric(dollarPerSingleRaw)} /ST</Badge>
```

**Impact:**
- Clean display: `$0.150 /ST` instead of `$$0.150 /ST`
- Affects all 4 performance badges ($/ST, $/MT, adj $/ST, adj $/MT)

**Files Modified:**

### Major Design: Basic to Advanced Mode Transition

**Issue Identified:**
When switching from Basic to Advanced mode in the Valuation Rules page, Baseline rules appear empty:
- 0 conditions shown
- 1 action with blank value
- Priority and RuleGroups exist correctly
- Unable to edit beyond Basic mode overrides

**Root Cause:**
Baseline rules are created as **placeholders** by `BaselineLoaderService`:
- `conditions: []` (empty array)
- `value_usd: 0.0` (placeholder)
- Metadata contains field configuration (`valuation_buckets`, `formula_text`) but not converted to executable conditions/actions

For example, DDR Generation field with "DDR3: 0.7x, DDR4: 1.0x, DDR5: 1.3x" stored in metadata is not expanded into:
- Rule 1: Condition (ddr_generation = ddr3) → Action (0.7x multiplier)
- Rule 2: Condition (ddr_generation = ddr4) → Action (1.0x multiplier)
- Rule 3: Condition (ddr_generation = ddr5) → Action (1.3x multiplier)

**Solution Designed:**
Implemented **on-demand baseline rule hydration** via ADR-0003 and comprehensive PRD.

**Hydration Strategy:**
1. **User-Initiated:** Require explicit user action (banner + button in Advanced mode)
2. **Expanded Rules:** Create new `ValuationRuleV2` records for each expanded rule
3. **One Rule Per Enum Value:** For enum multiplier fields (e.g., DDR Generation)
4. **Preserve Metadata:** Link expanded rules to original via `hydration_source_rule_id`
5. **Hide Foreign Key Rules:** Filter rules with `is_foreign_key_rule: true` in Advanced UI

**Documents Created:**
- **PRD:** `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/docs/project_plans/valuation-rules/basic-to-advanced-transition-prd.md` (400+ lines)
- **ADR-0003:** `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/docs/architecture/adr/0003-baseline-rule-hydration-strategy.md` (comprehensive architecture decision)
- **Implementation Plan:** `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/docs/project_plans/valuation-rules/basic-to-advanced-implementation-plan.md` (5-6 day plan, 5 phases)

**Status:**
- ✅ Bug fixes completed (multiplier, duplicate $)
- ✅ Design documents completed
- ⏳ Implementation plan ready for execution
- 📋 Estimated: 5-6 days for full implementation

**Next Steps:**
1. Review PRD and ADR with stakeholders
2. Assign implementation to backend-architect + ui-engineer
3. Execute Phase 1 (backend hydration service)
4. Continue sequential phases per implementation plan

### 2025-10-14 — Baseline Rule Hydration Implementation (Phases 1-4 Complete) ✅
Implemented complete baseline rule hydration system to enable full editing of baseline rules in Advanced mode.

#### Phase 1: Backend - Hydration Service (100%)
- **Implementation**: Created `BaselineHydrationService` in `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/baseline_hydration.py`
  - `HydrationResult` dataclass for returning hydration results
  - `hydrate_baseline_rules()` - Ruleset-level hydration with idempotency
  - `hydrate_single_rule()` - Single rule hydration with routing
  - Three hydration strategies:
    - `_hydrate_enum_multiplier()` - Expands enum fields into multiple condition-based rules
    - `_hydrate_formula()` - Creates single rule with formula action
    - `_hydrate_fixed()` - Creates single rule with fixed value action
- **Key Features**: Converts multiplier decimals to percentages (0.7 → 70.0), links expanded rules via metadata, deactivates placeholders
- **Testing**: 13 unit tests achieving 98%+ coverage, all passing
- **Files**: `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/baseline_hydration.py` (313 lines), `tests/services/test_baseline_hydration.py`
- **Commit**: `eb36bed` - feat: Implement Phase 1 - Baseline Rule Hydration Service

#### Phase 2: API Endpoints (100%)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/baseline/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/hydrate`
- **Schemas**: Created in `packages/core/dealbrain_core/schemas/baseline.py`
  - `HydrateBaselineRequest` (actor field)
  - `HydrationSummaryItem` (rule expansion details)
  - `HydrateBaselineResponse` (status, counts, summary)
- **Testing**: 7 integration tests covering success flow, errors, idempotency, schema validation
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500)
- **Files**: `packages/core/dealbrain_core/schemas/baseline.py`, `apps/api/dealbrain_api/api/baseline.py`, `tests/test_baseline_hydration_api.py`
- **Commit**: `016a219` - feat: Implement Phase 2 - Baseline Hydration API Endpoints

#### Phase 3: Frontend Detection & UI (100%)
- **Components**: Created `HydrationBanner` component in `apps/web/app/valuation-rules/_components/hydration-banner.tsx`
  - Alert with Info icon and clear messaging
  - CTA button with loading state (spinner)
  - Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- **Detection Logic**: Added memoized hooks in `apps/web/app/valuation-rules/page.tsx`
  - `hasPlaceholderRules` - Detects `baseline_placeholder && !hydrated`
  - `hasHydratedRules` - Detects `hydrated === true`
- **API Integration**: Created hydration API client in `apps/web/lib/api/baseline.ts`
  - React Query mutation with success/error handling
  - Toast notifications with rule counts
  - Query invalidation for automatic UI updates
- **Rule Filtering**: Enhanced `filteredRuleGroups` to hide foreign key rules and deactivated placeholders
- **TypeScript**: Zero compilation errors, types match backend schemas exactly
- **Files**: 4 files created/modified with +223 lines
- **Commit**: `320bc2d` - feat: Implement Phase 3 - Frontend Hydration Detection & UI
