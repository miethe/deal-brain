## Current Phase: Phase 7 Complete ✅
Focus: Multi-Pane Layout & Static Navigation

### 2025-10-10 — Valuation Rules Remediation Planning
- Reviewed request log `docs/project_plans/requests/10-10.md` to map rule-engine regressions in listings valuation.
- Noted Celery task signature drift (`enqueue_listing_recalculation` vs `recalculate_listings_task`) blocking rule updates.
- Captured UI gaps: per-unit action builder lacks metric selector; ruleset toggle state not persisting or visually contained.
- Lesson: keep task payload parity and UX controls aligned with backend capabilities to surface valuation adjustments.
- Synced Celery task signatures and added valuation logging + regression tests with Celery stubs to keep recalculation stable in dev.
- Added canonical per-unit metric selector with reusable options, backend validation, and service-level guardrails.
- Stabilized listing override baseline handling, refreshed select layout, and covered reset flow with a React Testing Library spec.

### 2025-10-11 — RAM/Storage Valuation Foundation
- Landed Alembic migration `0017` to introduce normalized `ram_spec` and `storage_profile` tables, link them to listings, and backfill existing rows from legacy RAM/storage fields.
- Extended listing services and seeds to auto-resolve specs and profiles on create/update flows, exposing `ram_type`, `ram_speed_mhz`, and profile references through FieldRegistry.
- Enriched rule evaluation context and action metrics with RAM speed/capacity plus primary/secondary storage profile quantities for spec-based valuation rules.

## Gap Analysis Findings (10-2-2025)

After comprehensive review of PRD, Implementation Plan, and completed phases, the following gaps were identified:

### Critical Missing Features:
1. **RAM/Storage Dropdowns** - Requested in original 10-2-2.md but never implemented
   - RAM (GB) should be dropdown with common values (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128)
   - Primary Storage (GB) should be dropdown with common values (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096)
   - Phase 2.3 notes claim this was done, but listings-table.tsx shows it was NOT implemented
   - Currently only Storage Type has dropdown, RAM and Storage are plain text inputs

2. **Column Width Text Wrapping** - Requested but not fully implemented
   - Listings Title column and other non-long-text fields should never truncate
   - Should wrap text and/or enforce minimum width per field
   - Currently text can be cut off when resizing columns
   - Phase 2.1 notes mention min width constraints but not implemented in listings table

3. **Inline Dropdown Option Creation** - Partially implemented
   - Phase 2.3 claims ComboBox with inline creation, but EditableCell uses plain select
   - No "Create new option" functionality when typing in dropdowns
   - Missing the confirmation dialog for adding new options
   - useFieldOptions hook may exist but not integrated into EditableCell

4. **Modal Styling** - Visual consistency issues
   - RuleBuilderModal has DialogContent with max-w-3xl but no proper internal padding structure
   - Needs consistent padding/margin treatment like other modals
   - Form sections should have proper spacing

### Implementation Status:
- Phase 1-2: ⚠️ Claimed complete but missing dropdown functionality
- Phase 3: ✅ Complete (Backend APIs)
- Phase 4: ✅ Complete (Global Fields UI)
- Phase 5: ⚠️ Claimed complete but modal styling needs work
- Phase 6: ✅ Complete (Listings Valuation Column)
- Phase 7: ✅ Complete (Multi-Pane Layout & Static Nav)

## Remediation Complete ✅ (10-2-2025)

All identified gaps have been successfully addressed and committed:

### Completed Remediation Tasks:
1. ✅ **Modal Styling Standardization**
   - All valuation rule modals now have consistent px-6 py-4 padding
   - Form content properly wrapped in containers
   - Professional, cohesive appearance across all dialogs

2. ✅ **Column Width Constraints**
   - Title column enforces 200px minimum width
   - Text wrapping enabled for Title column
   - Visual indicator (amber dashed border) when at constraint
   - Prevents text truncation on important fields

3. ✅ **ComboBox Integration**
   - Existing ComboBox component integrated into EditableCell
   - Works for all dropdown fields (enum, number with options)
   - Inline option creation with confirmation dialog
   - Auto-refresh after new option added

4. ✅ **RAM/Storage Dropdowns**
   - RAM (GB): 9 common values (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128)
   - Storage (GB): 6 common values (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096)
   - Both support custom values via inline creation
   - Confirmation dialog before adding to global fields

### Additional Fixes:
- Added forwardRef to Input component

- useUrlSync() hook with 300ms debounced updates
- Bidirectional sync: store ↔ URL params
- Browser back/forward navigation support
- Mount-time hydration with validation

**Tab Navigation:**
- Tabs component (Radix UI wrapper)
- Catalog/Data tabs with state persistence
- Data tab preserves existing ListingsTable
- Catalog tab shows grid view

**Shared Filters:**
- ListingsFilters component with sticky positioning
- Text search (200ms debounce), Form Factor dropdown, Manufacturer dropdown, Price slider
- Conditional Clear button
- Fully integrated with Zustand store

### Phase 2: Grid View Implementation ✅
**Grid View & Cards:**
- Responsive grid: 1 col (mobile) → 2 (tablet) → 3 (desktop) → 4 (large)
- ListingCard component (React.memo optimized)
- Card sections: Header, Badges, Price, Performance, Metadata, Footer
- Click card → details dialog, hover → quick actions
- Empty states: no listings, no filter matches, loading skeletons

**Performance Badges:**
- 4 badges: $/ST, $/MT, adj $/ST, adj $/MT (3 decimals)
- Color accent: emerald for better adjusted values
- Tooltips with Radix UI
- isAdjustedBetter logic (lower is better for price efficiency)

**Dialogs:**
- QuickEditDialog: Title, Price, Condition, Status fields
- ListingDetailsDialog: KPI tiles, performance badges, specs grid, link to full page
- React Query integration for fetching/mutations
- Toast notifications for success/errors
- Zustand state management for open/close

**Client-Side Filtering:**
- Search by title, CPU, manufacturer, series, model
- Filter by form factor, manufacturer, price range
- Sort by adjusted $/MT (ascending - best value first)
- useMemo for performance

### Phase 3: Dense List View Implementation ✅
**Dense Table Component:**
- Created dense-table.tsx with virtual scrolling (@tanstack/react-virtual)
- Columns: Title (with badges), CPU (with scores), Price, Adjusted, $/ST, $/MT, Actions
- Row height: 64px, overscan: 5 items
- Virtual scrolling for smooth 1000+ row performance

**Interactions:**
- Hover action clusters with opacity-70 → opacity-100 transitions
- Bulk selection: header checkbox, row checkboxes, shift+click support
- Keyboard navigation: arrows, enter (open details), escape (clear focus)
- Bulk selection panel appears when rows selected

**Performance:**
- useVirtualizer with dynamic row calculations
- Memoized row components
- Efficient state management for selections

### Phase 4: Master/Detail View Implementation ✅
**Split Layout:**
- Responsive grid: 1 col mobile, 4/6 split desktop (lg:grid-cols-10)
- Master list (left): 4 cols, 70vh ScrollArea
- Detail panel (right): 6 cols, full specs

**Master List Component:**
- Button-based list items with selection state
- Compare checkboxes below each item
- Keyboard shortcuts: j/k (navigate), c (toggle compare)
- Auto-select first item on mount

**Detail Panel:**
- Created KpiMetric component (accent variants: good/warn/neutral)
- Created KeyValue component for spec display
- KPI metrics: Price, Adjusted, $/ST, $/MT with accents
- Full specs: CPU, Hardware, Metadata, Ports (when available)
- Performance badges reused from Grid view

**Compare Drawer:**
- Sheet component (bottom, 60vh height)
- Floating "Compare (N)" button (fixed bottom-right)
- Grid of mini-cards (1-3 cols responsive)
- Shows first 6 items, scroll message if more
- Each card: Title, Adjusted price, $/MT, CPU, Scores, Performance badges
- Remove button and Clear All functionality
