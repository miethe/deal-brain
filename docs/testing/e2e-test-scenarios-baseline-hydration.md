# E2E Test Scenarios: Baseline Rule Hydration

**Status:** Deferred - To be implemented in future testing sprint
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Related:** [Implementation Plan](../project_plans/valuation-rules/basic-to-advanced-transition/basic-to-advanced-implementation-plan.md), [PRD](../project_plans/valuation-rules/basic-to-advanced-transition/basic-to-advanced-transition-prd.md), [ADR-0003](../architecture/adr/0003-baseline-rule-hydration-strategy.md)

## Overview

This document outlines the end-to-end (E2E) test scenarios for the baseline rule hydration feature. These tests should be implemented when the project adopts an E2E testing framework (Playwright or Cypress).

**Purpose:** Ensure the complete user journey for hydrating baseline rules when switching from Basic to Advanced mode works correctly across the entire stack (frontend, API, database).

## Prerequisites

### Testing Framework Requirements
- E2E testing framework installed (Playwright recommended, Cypress alternative)
- Test database with seed data
- Authenticated test user session
- Sample ruleset with baseline placeholder rules

### Test Data Setup
Before running these tests, ensure:
1. At least one active ruleset with baseline placeholder rules exists
2. Placeholder rules have `baseline_placeholder: true` in metadata
3. Placeholder rules include various field types:
   - Enum multiplier (e.g., DDR Generation)
   - Formula (e.g., RAM Capacity calculation)
   - Fixed value (e.g., Base depreciation)
4. Test listings exist to verify valuation impact

### Scenario 3: Successful Hydration - Banner Dismissal

**Test ID:** E2E-HYDRATE-003
**Priority:** High
**User Story:** US-2 (Edit Baseline Rules in Advanced Mode)

**Test Steps:**
1. Complete Scenario 2 (trigger hydration)
2. Wait for hydration to complete (typically <2 seconds)
3. Observe UI changes post-hydration

**Expected Results:**
- Success toast notification appears with:
  - Title: "Baseline Rules Prepared"
  - Message showing counts (e.g., "Created 18 rules from 12 baseline fields")
- Hydration banner disappears
- Rules table refreshes and shows expanded rules:
  - Rules now have conditions (for enum types)
  - Actions have non-zero values
  - Multiple rules created for enum fields (e.g., DDR3, DDR4, DDR5)
- Page remains in Advanced mode

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### Scenario 4: Expanded Rules Display

**Test ID:** E2E-HYDRATE-004
**Priority:** High
**User Story:** US-1 (View Baseline Rules in Advanced Mode)

**Test Steps:**
1. Complete Scenario 3 (successful hydration)
2. Locate a previously placeholder enum rule (e.g., "DDR Generation")
3. Verify expanded rules structure

**Expected Results:**
For enum multiplier fields:
- Original placeholder rule is NOT visible (marked inactive)
- Multiple new rules appear with pattern: "{Field Name}: {Enum Value}"
  - Example: "DDR Generation: DDR3", "DDR Generation: DDR4", "DDR Generation: DDR5"
- Each expanded rule shows:
  - 1 condition: `field = enum_value`
  - 1 action: Multiplier with converted value (e.g., 0.7 â†’ 70.0)
- Rules are grouped visually in same Rule Group

For formula fields:
- Single rule with formula action
- No conditions (always applies)

For fixed value fields:
- Single rule with fixed_value action
- Value populated from metadata

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Enum fields expand to correct number of rules
- [ ] Condition field paths are correct

2. Click "Edit" button on one of the hydrated rules
3. Make changes:
   - Modify condition value
   - Update action value
   - Change rule name
4. Save changes
5. Verify updates persist

**Expected Results:**

3. Verify they are not displayed in Advanced mode

**Expected Results:**
- Rules with `is_foreign_key_rule: true` in metadata do NOT appear in rules table
- Rule counts exclude foreign key rules
- No visual clutter from system-managed rules

**Optional Enhancement:**
- If "Show System Rules" toggle exists, verify:

2. Click "Basic" mode toggle
3. Observe Basic mode display

**Expected Results:**
- Mode switches to Basic successfully
- Hydrated baseline fields show one of:

3. Click "Prepare Baseline Rules for Editing"
4. Observe error handling

**Expected Results:**
- Error toast appears with:
  - Title: "Hydration Failed"
  - Error message (user-friendly, not raw stack trace)
  - Variant: Destructive (red styling)
- Hydration banner remains visible
- Button returns to enabled state (can retry)
- Rules table shows original placeholder rules (no partial hydration)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### Scenario 10: Valuation Impact - Before and After Hydration

**Test ID:** E2E-HYDRATE-010
**Priority:** Medium
**Functional Requirement:** Hydration should NOT change valuation results

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to Listings page
2. Select a test listing with known base price
3. Note the adjusted price and valuation breakdown (before hydration)
4. Navigate to Valuation Rules page
5. Complete Scenario 3 (hydrate baseline rules)
6. Return to Listings page
7. Re-evaluate the same test listing
8. Compare adjusted price and breakdown

**Expected Results:**
- Adjusted price remains EXACTLY the same
- Valuation breakdown shows:
  - Same total adjustment amount
  - Possibly different rule names (expanded rules instead of placeholders)
  - Same individual adjustment amounts per field
- No valuation calculation changes introduced by hydration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Adjusted price identical (to 2 decimal places)
- [ ] Total adjustment identical
- [ ] Individual field adjustments match
- [ ] Breakdown structure is valid

**Screenshot Points:**
- Valuation breakdown before hydration
- Valuation breakdown after hydration (side-by-side comparison)

## Additional Test Considerations

### Performance Tests
- **Hydration Speed:** Measure time for hydration of various ruleset sizes
  - Small ruleset (10 rules): <1 second
  - Medium ruleset (50 rules): <3 seconds
  - Large ruleset (100+ rules): <5 seconds
- **UI Responsiveness:** Ensure UI remains responsive during hydration

### Accessibility Tests
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All hydration flow accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader:** Banner and button properly announced
- **Focus Management:** Focus moves appropriately after hydration

### Cross-Browser Tests
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Verify consistent behavior across browsers

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Test on mobile viewport sizes
- Verify banner displays correctly
- Ensure button is tappable

## Test Execution Checklist

When implementing these E2E tests:

- [ ] Set up test database with seed data
- [ ] Create fixture for baseline ruleset
- [ ] Implement Scenario 1-3 (critical path)
- [ ] Implement Scenario 4-6 (expanded rules validation)
- [ ] Implement Scenario 7 (mode switching)
- [ ] Implement Scenario 8-9 (edge cases and errors)
- [ ] Implement Scenario 10 (valuation verification)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Document test data setup in README
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline to run E2E tests
- [ ] Create test report dashboard

## Maintenance Notes

### When to Update These Tests
- When hydration UI changes (banner text, button labels)
- When new field types are added
- When hydration logic changes
- After any breaking API changes

### Known Limitations
- Tests assume synchronous hydration (no background jobs)
- Tests do not cover dehydration (Phase 5 feature)
- Tests assume single-user environment (no concurrent hydration)
