# Enhancements and Fixes

Date: 10-3-25

The following requests and fixes are proposed to improve the user experience and functionality of the application. Each item needs to be evaluated and designed thoroughly for implementation into the app. The implementation of each should then be planned.

## Notes

- Review @architecture.md for current architecture overview.

## Requests

### Listings

- The Valuation column seems to have odd formatting, with some showing a negative savings, some showing just the price. And with the savings, the formatting is messy. There should be a clean and consistent format for the Valuation column, showing both the price and savings (if any) in a clear manner. For example, "$500 (-$50 savings)" or "$500 (no savings)". This should include clear distinctions using colors and other indicators when savings are negative, zero, or positive, as well as when savings hit various thresholds, of which should be configurable.

### Tables

- Dropdown fields must have a way to add new options directly from the dropdown when editing/creating an entity, without needing to go to Global Fields first.
- The "Search" field within the dropdown should have no text. The box should have clean margins, similar to the dropdown options below it.

### Global Fields

- Currently, dropdown type is named "Enum". This should be renamed to "Dropdown" for clarity with non-technical users.
- When creating a field and Dropdown/Enum type is selected, a field "Field Options" should appear. This should show a single empty text entry box with an "Add Option" button below it. Clicking "Add Option" should add another text entry box below the existing one. This should allow users to add as many options as they want. The options should be saved as an array of strings in the database.
- When editing a field of Dropdown/Enum type, the "Field Options" should show the existing options as text entry boxes, with an "Add Option" button below them. Users should be able to edit the existing options, delete them (with a delete button next to each option), and add new options.
- Every field type should have an optional "Default Value" setting. If set, this value should be pre-selected when creating a new entity of that type. For Dropdown/Enum fields, this should be a dropdown showing the available options. For other field types, it should be an appropriate input (text box, number input, checkbox, etc).
- Every field should be editable, even those "Managed via schema". If certain fields must be locked from editing (Entity, Key, Type), they should be visually indicated as such in the UI, but still allow editing of other properties like Name, Description, Options, Default Value, etc.

- CPUs
    - Cores, Threads, Series, and Manufacturer should be dropdowns with common values.
    - Every CPU should have a CPU Mark score, pulled from cpubenchmark.net. This should be a numeric field.
    - CPUs should have an optional "Integrated Graphics" field for a GPU Mark score, also pulled from cpubenchmark.net. This should be a numeric field.
