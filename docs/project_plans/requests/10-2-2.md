# Enhancements and Fixes Set 2

Date: 10-2-25

The following requests and fixes are proposed to improve the user experience and functionality of the application. Each item needs to be evaluated and designed thoroughly for implementation into the app. The implementation of each should then be planned.

## Notes

- Review @architecture.md for current architecture overview.
- Remember that the goal of this site is to provide accurate and explainable valuations for computer hardware listings, based on a set of adjustable rules and market data. For example, a user should be able to add a listing of a computer from Amazon with the relevant details - ie CPU, RAM, Storage, GPU, etc - and have the system provide a valuation based on current market data and the user's valuation rules. 

## Requests

### Tables

- All tables should use dropdown fields for relevant fields. This is currently in place for Storage Types. RAM (GB) and Primary Storage (GB) should also be dropdowns, with common values for each. Every dropdown when editing a field (not filtering) should support adding a new dropdown option directly from the dropdown, without needing to go to Global Fields to add it first. The same should be true for Modals and any other forms in the app which are editing/creating/searching/etc dropdown fields.
- The table on the Listings page should have a column for "Valuation" showing the calculated valuation based on the current valuation rules. This column should be sortable, allowing users to sort listings by their valuation. The valuation should be calculated in real-time based on the current rules, and should update automatically when the rules are changed or when listings are added/edited.
- Tables should support locked columns, which remain visible when horizontally scrolling. This is especially important for tables with many columns, such as the Listings table. The first columns (usually the ID and Title columns) should be locked by default, but users should be able to choose which columns to lock via a settings option. This should also include the Edit button.
- Changing the width of a column should never allow cutting off any text. If it won't fit in the new size and can't wrap, it should be locked from moving any further.
- Changing the width of columns of tables is currently not very responsive even with moderate amounts of data. Tables must support pagination and be optimized for performance to allow for smooth resizing of columns regardless of the amount of data in the table.
- A given page might have multiple panes, with one or more panes containing tables. Panes with tables should be vertically sized to allow all panes to show on the current page size, with a certain minimum height for each pane. A page with many panes might still overflow and require scrolling the entire page vertically. However, if room allows, the table pane(s) should extend vertically to show more of the table without needing to scroll within the table itself. The goal is to optimize the use of screen space and improve readability. Users should always be able to resize the height of a pane by dragging the edge of the pane, allowing them to customize their view based on their preferences and the amount of data they are working with.
- The sidebar and nav bar should always remain static, even when a page has multiple panes and requires vertical scrolling. This ensures that navigation options are always accessible to the user, improving the overall user experience.

### Global Fields

- When adding/editing fields, currently you can choose the Field Type. One option is Multi-select. Instead, there should be a dropdown Type, and after selecting a checkbox should appear below for "Allow Multiple Selections". This would allow for a field to be a dropdown, but also allow multiple selections if desired.
- For dropdown fields, there should be an option to add all options it should be populated with.
- Every Global Field should be editable. However, those which are core to other parts of the app should be locked in the UI from changing important aspects of the field, such as the Entity, Key, Type, etc.
