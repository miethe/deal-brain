# Enhancements and Fixes - Rule Builder

Date: 10-2-25

The following requests and fixes are proposed to improve the user experience and functionality of the application. Each item needs to be evaluated and designed thoroughly for implementation into the app. The implementation of each should then be planned.

## Notes

- Review @architecture.md for current architecture overview.
- Remember that the goal of this site is to provide accurate and explainable valuations for computer hardware listings, based on a set of adjustable rules and market data. For example, a user should be able to add a listing of a computer from Amazon with the relevant details - ie CPU, RAM, Storage, GPU, etc - and have the system provide a valuation based on current market data and the user's valuation rules. 

## Requests

### Valuation

- Rules should have a comprehensive Rule Builder interface, allowing users to create complex rules with multiple conditions and actions. This should include support for AND/OR logic, nested conditions, and a wide range of actions (e.g., set price, apply discount, flag listing, etc.). The Rule Builder should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear instructions and examples to guide users through the process of creating rules.
    - When creating/editing a rule, users should be able to select from a list of predefined conditions and actions, as well as create custom conditions and actions if needed.
    - Conditions should populate from a list of available fields. It should support first selecting an Entity (Listing, Component, etc), then a Field (Price, RAM, etc), then an Operator (equals, greater than, contains, etc), and finally a Value (which should be a dropdown if the field is a dropdown field).
    - There should be an example listing used by the Rule Builder to show how the rule would apply to a real listing, updating in real-time as the rule is built.
- Rules should support versioning, allowing users to create and manage multiple versions of a rule.
