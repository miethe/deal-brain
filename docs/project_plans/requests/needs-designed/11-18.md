# Enhancement Requests - Nov 18th, 2025

## Requests

- Importing listings from Amazon (without an API key) still do not populate almost any of the fields. This is despite most of the data presumably being available on the Amazon product page. It would be great if more fields could be auto-populated when importing from Amazon.
    - Worst case, we should try to scrape more data from the product title and description if it's not available in structured data. For example, Amazon titles often list the CPU, RAM, manufacturer, model, etc, and sometimes other data. We could use NLP to extract these details.

- When doing a quick edit on a listing via the modal, more fields should be available to edit. Specifically, it should allow editing the key fields, ie CPU, RAM, Storage, GPU. These should use the exact same fields and validation as the full edit page, to ensure consistency.
- When viewing a listing modal, there should be a button in the bottom toolbar of the modal to "Quick Edit" which opens the quick edit modal directly from the view modal. This would streamline the workflow of viewing and editing listings.

- When adding/importing a listing, the site should update/refresh automatically. Currently, users must manually refresh the page to see newly added listings. An automatic refresh or dynamic update would improve usability. Perhaps we could use SSE or similar to push updates to the UI when new listings are added.
    - Adding/editing a listing or Valuation Rules should also trigger a refresh/recalculation of the relevant fields, so that users don't have to manually run the refresh task to see updated valuations. However, this should be optimized to only run on the affected listings to avoid performance issues, and even potentially only when relevant fields are updated.

- When viewing the full page of a listing, there should be an edit button in the top right corner next to "Delete" button which opens the full edit page for that listing. This would provide a more intuitive way to access the edit functionality from the listing view page.

- The /cpus Catalog page should allow sorting CPUs. This should include all available fields, such as clock speed, core count, TDP, etc. This would help users find CPUs that meet their specific needs more easily.
    - Additionally, we should support filtering CPUs based on those attached to existing listings and sorting based on the number of listings using each CPU. This would help users identify popular CPUs in the marketplace.

- List view for all entities (listings, CPUs, etc) should support adding additional columns using a column selector. This would allow users to customize their view and see the fields that are most relevant to them.
    - The selected columns should be persisted across sessions, so that users don't have to reselect their preferred columns each time they visit the site.
    - All available fields for each entity type should be included in the column selector.

- UI bug: Sliders on the site, such as the CPU filters on /cpus only have a single circle/handle. The user can still set both sides of the range by clicking on the slider track, but it is not intuitive. All sliders should have two handles to clearly indicate the min and max values of the selected range.

- UI bug: when viewing any page in List view, the top row is hidden behind the header of the table. This should be updated so that all rows are fully in view.
