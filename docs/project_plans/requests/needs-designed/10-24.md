# Enhancements and Fixes

Date: 10-24-25

The following requests and fixes are proposed to improve the user experience and functionality of the application. Each item needs to be evaluated and designed thoroughly for implementation into the app. The implementation of each should then be planned.

## Notes

- Review @architecture.md for current architecture overview.

## Existing Behaviors

### Listings

- On the /listings page, when viewing the Data tab, the site becomes very slow to respond. We should optimize the performance of this page to ensure a smooth user experience even with large datasets.

### Entities

- Links to entities, such as the CPU link on a Listing, navigate to a 404 page at /catalog/cpus/[id]. We need to implement proper entity detail pages for these links to navigate to.
- Every entity should have a dedicated view on the /global-fields page, similar to Listings and CPUs. This will provide a consistent experience across all entity types, allowing fields and data to be viewed and managed in one place.
  - This would allow creating/editing Entity specs from a central location. Currently, it is not possible to edit entities like RAM Specs or Storage Specs, so mistakes persist and can't be fixed.
