# Enhancements and Fixes

Date: 9-30-25

The following requests and fixes are proposed to improve the user experience and functionality of the application. Each item needs to be evaluated and designed thoroughly for implementation into the app. The implementation of each should then be planned.

## Notes

## Requests

### Tables

- All tables should be sized dynamically based on the number of entries (rows) and the number of fields (columns). This means that if there are many entries but few fields, the table should be taller and narrower, and if there are few entries but many fields, the table should be shorter and wider. The goal is to optimize the use of screen space and improve readability. The table should also support horizontal and vertical scrolling if the content exceeds the available space. The table should be bounded within it's container, and should extend vertically further down the page if needed and if there is room, but with clean margins on all sides.
- Column widths should be adjustable by dragging the edges of the column headers, and the table should remember the user's column width preferences for future visits.
- Every column header should have a tooltip that displays the full field name when hovered over, especially for fields with long names that may be truncated in the table view. There should also be a simple delineation between columns, such as a light border or alternating background colors for rows, to improve readability.
- Filters for each column should be available, allowing users to filter entries based on any field, including custom fields. Currently, there is a text box for each column; however, typing in the box does not show text except on refresh, and does not appear to actually filter the entries.
- All tables should support inline editing for all fields, including custom fields. There should also be a bulk edit option that allows for selecting multiple entries and applying changes to a specific field across all selected entries.
- There should be a sort function for each column in the table, allowing users to sort entries based on any field, including custom fields.
- Filtering fields which uses a dropdown select should support searching and selecting multiple options from the list of available options, similar as when editing data with those fields.

### Global Fields

- There should be a button linking to the import functionality, allowing users to import entries directly from the Global Fields page. This should allow adding a file with the imports on the page, but the navigate the user to the normal import flow.
- Fields should have an edit and delete option. Deleting a field should remove it from all entries, and editing a field should allow changing its name, type, and validation rules. We should support locked fields which are required and cannot be deleted or have their type changed.
- Fields which are dropdown should support adding, editing, and deleting options. Deleting an option should remove it from all entries that use it. This should be performed in the same modal as the field edit.

### Listings

- There should be an "Add Listing" button on the Listings page that opens a modal to create a new listing. The modal should include all fields, including custom fields, and support validation rules.
