# Enhancements and Fixes

Date: 10-4-25

The following requests and fixes are proposed to improve the user experience and functionality of the application. Each item needs to be evaluated and designed thoroughly for implementation into the app. The implementation of each should then be planned.

## Notes

- Review @architecture.md for current architecture overview.

## Requests

### Listings

- There should be 2 fields for Listings related to CPU Mark scores from PassMark:
  - $/CPU Mark (Single)
  - $/CPU Mark (Multi)
- $/CPU Mark (Single) and $/CPU Mark (Multi) Fields should contain 2 values:
  - $/CPU Mark
  - $/CPU Mark (Adjusted)
- $/CPU Mark should be calculated as the listing price divided by the CPU Mark score (single or multi, respectively). There should be 2 values shown for each field:
  - $/CPU Mark: This is calculated using the listing price as-is.
  - $/CPU Mark (Adjusted): This is calculated using the listing price minus any adjustments that have been applied to the listing via valuations rules, ie subtracting cost of RAM, storage, etc. This provides a more accurate representation of the value of the CPU in relation to its performance.
- All data in Listings related to a CPU should be automatically pulled from the CPU table based on the selected CPU.

### Tables



### Global Fields

- There are a few columns that should be part of the default fields for CPUs which are not currently included. These include:
  - Passmark Single Thread
  - Passmark Multi-Thread
  - Integrated Graphics (Yes/No)
  - Integrated Graphics Model (if applicable)
  - Integrated Graphics Score (if applicable)
  - TDP (Thermal Design Power)
  - Release Year
- There are a few columns that should be part of the default fields for Listings which are not currently included. These include:
  - Manufacturer
  - Series
  - Model Number
  - Form Factor (e.g., Desktop, Laptop, Server)
  - Ports (e.g., USB, HDMI, Ethernet)
    - Ports should be a slightly more complex field that allows for multiple selections and quantities. For example, a user should be able to specify that a listing has 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI port, and 2 Ethernet ports. This should be implemented as a sub-field or a related table that allows for this level of detail, but with the information being combined and displayed within the main Ports field in Listings.

### Valuations

- There should be a base valuation which is automatically applied to all listings. This base valuation should be editable by the user, but it should be a single value that applies to the entire listing. This base valuation should be separate from the component-based valuations and should be displayed prominently in the valuation section.
- When viewing Listings, there should be 2 valuation options available: "Base Valuation" and "Adjusted Valuation". The Base Valuation should show the single base value for the listing, while the Adjusted Valuation should break down the valuation by component based on the valuation rules, showing how much each component contributes to the total valuation.
