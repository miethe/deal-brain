# Enhancements and Fixes

Date: 9-27-25

The following requests and fixes are proposed to improve the user experience and functionality of the application. Each item needs to be evaluated and designed thoroughly for implementation into the app. The implementation of each should then be planned.

## Notes

## Requests

### Imports

- When mapping during import, there should be an option in the dropdown to add new fields. This should open a modal to define the new field (name, type, validation) and then add it to the mapping.

### Listings

- We require a method for creating new global fields for Listings, CPUs, GPUs, etc. This should be done in a way that allows for easy addition of new fields without requiring code changes or database migrations. The fields should support various data types (string, number, boolean, enum) and include validation rules.
- Fields:
    - RAM, primary and secondary storage sizes and types should all be dropdown selects with predefined options.
    - Ports should be a multi-select dropdown with predefined options.
    - Additional fields should be added as needed, with the ability to define custom fields with a "Add Field" button.
- When adding a Listing, manually or via import, if a CPU does not already exist, it should be created. For manual adds, there should be an option at the end of the dropdown to "Add new CPU" which opens a modal to create the CPU. For imports, if a CPU is not found, it should be created automatically.
- The Listings table should support inline editing for all fields, including custom fields. There should also be a bulk edit option that allows for selecting multiple listings and applying changes to a specific field across all selected listings.
- The Listings table should have a filter option for each column, allowing users to filter listings based on any field, including custom fields.
- The Listings table should have a global grouping option, allowing users to group listings by any field, including custom fields.
- There should be a sort function for each column in the Listings table, allowing users to sort listings based on any field, including custom fields.

### Screens

- There should be a tab or section in the sidebar for "Global Fields" where users can view and manage all custom fields for Listings, CPUs, GPUs, etc. This section should allow for adding, editing, and deleting custom fields.
- There should be a tab in the sidebar for "Reference" which contains sub-tabs for CPUs, GPUs, Valuation Rules, Ports, and Custom Fields. Each tab should display a data grid with inline editing capabilities and bulk edit options.

## Fixes

- Currently, the Listings page has a nested table also titled Listings. Instead, this inner title should be removed.
