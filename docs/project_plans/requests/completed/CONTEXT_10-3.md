---

## Enhancement Domains

### 1. Listings Valuation Display
**Problem:** Inconsistent, messy formatting with no visual hierarchy
**Solution:** Clean, color-coded display with configurable thresholds and interactive breakdown modal

**Key Features:**
- Color-coded badges (green=savings, red=premium, gray=neutral)
- Intensity thresholds (light/medium/dark based on percentage)
- Click-to-expand breakdown modal
- Configurable deal thresholds (good/great/premium warning)

**Impact:** Users identify best deals in <10 seconds (vs. manual comparison)

---

### 2. Table Dropdown Workflows
**Problem:** Must navigate to Global Fields to add dropdown options, causing context switching friction
**Solution:** Inline option creation directly from any dropdown field

**Key Features:**
- Type non-existent value → confirmation dialog → option added
- Syncs to Global Fields automatically
- Clean search field styling (no placeholder text, consistent margins)
- Applies to all dropdowns (listings, CPUs, custom entities)

**Impact:** 70% of options created inline, 40% reduction in data entry time

---

### 3. Global Fields Management
**Problem:** "Enum" confusing terminology, no options builder during creation, core fields appear fully locked
**Solution:** User-friendly terminology, options builder, default values, selective core field editing

**Key Features:**
- "Enum" → "Dropdown" throughout UI
- Options builder in create/edit forms (add/remove/reorder/CSV import)
- Default value configuration for all field types (polymorphic input)
- Core fields allow editing labels/descriptions/options (lock only Entity/Key/Type)

**Impact:** Zero "What is Enum?" support requests, default values on 80% of fields

---

### 4. CPU Data Enrichment
**Problem:** Missing benchmark scores, free-text fields prevent data quality
**Solution:** Structured benchmark fields, controlled dropdowns for manufacturer/series/cores/threads

**Key Features:**
- CPU Mark (Multi-Core) field
- CPU Mark (Single-Thread) field
- iGPU Mark (Integrated Graphics) field
- Manufacturer/Series/Cores/Threads as dropdowns with common values
- Inline creation for custom values

**Impact:** 90% CPU benchmark coverage within 1 month, accurate performance-based valuations

---

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Components

**New Components:**
- `ValuationCell` - Color-coded price display with delta badge
- `DeltaBadge` - Styled badge with icons and intensity variants
- `OptionsBuilder` - Drag-and-drop option management for dropdown fields
- `DefaultValueInput` - Polymorphic input adapting to field type

**Enhanced Components:**
- `ComboBox` - Added inline creation flow with confirmation dialog
- `ValuationBreakdownModal` - Improved layout with grouped rules and thumbnails

### Backend Services

**New Services:**
- `SettingsService` - Manage application-wide settings (valuation thresholds)

**New Models:**
- `ApplicationSettings` - Key-value store for app config

**Enhanced Services:**
- `CustomFieldService.add_field_option()` - Add option to dropdown field
- `CustomFieldService.remove_field_option()` - Remove option with usage check

### API Endpoints

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/settings/{key}` - Retrieve settings
- `PUT /api/settings/{key}` - Update settings
- `POST /api/fields/{field_id}/options` - Add dropdown option
- `DELETE /api/fields/{field_id}/options/{value}` - Remove dropdown option

**Modified Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/listings` - Ensure adjusted_price_usd always returned

### Database Changes

**Minimal Migrations:**
- `ApplicationSettings` table (key, value_json, description, updated_at)
- `cpu.igpu_mark` column (INTEGER NULL)
- Seed valuation thresholds: `{good_deal: 15.0, great_deal: 25.0, premium_warning: 10.0}`

**No Breaking Changes:**
- CustomFieldDefinition already has `options` and `default_value` columns
- CPU already has `cpu_mark_multi` and `cpu_mark_single` columns

## Key Learnings from Existing Codebase

### UI Component Patterns
- **Modal System:** Already have `ModalShell` with size variants (from Phase 1-2 UI enhancements)
- **Form Components:** Have `ComboBox`, `MultiComboBox`, `FormField`, `ValidatedInput` (ready to extend)
- **Table System:** `DataGrid` with virtualization, pagination, sticky columns (ready for valuation cell)

### Data Model Insights
- **CustomFieldDefinition:** Already supports `options` (JSON array), `default_value` (JSON), `is_locked` (boolean)
- **CPU Model:** Has `cpu_mark_multi`, `cpu_mark_single` but missing `igpu_mark`
- **Listing Model:** Has `adjusted_price_usd`, `list_price_usd`, `valuation_breakdown` (JSON)

### Existing Patterns to Leverage
- React Query for data fetching and cache invalidation
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

---

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Deal Identification:** <10 seconds to identify top 3 deals
- **Data Entry Speed:** 40% reduction in time to add listing with custom fields
- **Context Switching:** 70% of dropdown options created inline (vs. navigating to Global Fields)

### Data Quality
- **CPU Benchmark Coverage:** 90% of CPUs have CPU Mark scores within 1 month
- **Field Configuration:** 80% of new fields configured with default values

### Support/Training
- **Terminology Clarity:** 0 support requests about "What is Enum?"
- **User Adoption:** 80% of users create custom valuation rules within first week

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Identified Risks
1. **Color-only distinction fails accessibility** → Mitigated with icons + text labels
2. **Option creation race conditions** → Mitigated with optimistic UI + server-side deduplication
3. **CPU data migration complexity** → Mitigated with manual review step + validation
4. **Performance degradation with large datasets** → Mitigated with memoization + virtualization

### Technical Debt to Avoid
- **DO NOT** duplicate field option storage (keep single source in CustomFieldDefinition)
- **DO NOT** bypass validation on core field edits (enforce locked properties)
- **DO NOT** skip accessibility testing (critical for color-coded UI)

---

## Out of Scope (Deferred)

### Not Included in This Phase
- Historical valuation trends over time
- Comparative valuation across multiple rulesets
- Automated benchmark score fetching from cpubenchmark.net API
- Hierarchical/nested dropdowns (e.g., Manufacturer → Series → Model)
- User-specific threshold preferences
- Role-based field editing permissions

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review Planning Documents** - Stakeholder approval of PRD and implementation plan
2. **Create Phase 1 Tracking** - Detailed task tracking for valuation display
3. **Begin Implementation** - Start with backend settings infrastructure
4. **Iterate Based on Feedback** - Adjust as needed during development
