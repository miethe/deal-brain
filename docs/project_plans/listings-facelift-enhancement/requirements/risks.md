**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025

## Technical Risks

### Risk 1: Performance degradation with large valuation rulesets (50+ rules)

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High

**Description:**
Displaying and sorting 50+ rules in the valuation breakdown modal could cause performance degradation (slow sorting/filtering, UI lag).

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement pagination or lazy loading for inactive rules section
- Benchmark with 100+ rules during development
- Memoize sorting logic to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use virtualization for large lists if needed

**Contingency:**
- Implement progressive loading (show top rules first, load rest on demand)
- Add filtering capabilities to reduce visible rules
- Cache sorted results in React Query

---

### Risk 2: Image loading delays affecting LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)

**Likelihood:** High | **Impact:** Medium

**Description:**
Product images failing to load quickly or at all could affect Core Web Vitals, particularly LCP scores.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Use Next.js Image component with blur placeholder (LQIP)
- Implement lazy loading for below-fold images
- CDN for image hosting with proper caching headers
- Generate placeholder icons for missing images
- Preload critical images in `<head>`

**Contingency:**
- Fallback to manufacturer-based icons if image fails
- Fallback to generic PC icons if all else fails
- Graceful degradation without blocking page render

---

### Risk 3: React Query cache inconsistency between page and modal

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

**Description:**
Using identical listings in both detail page and modal could cause cache inconsistencies if data is updated in one context but not reflected in the other.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Use identical query keys between page and modal contexts
- Implement comprehensive cache invalidation strategy
- Store listing in single source of truth
- Invalidate all related queries on edit: `['listings', '*']`
- Integration tests for cache behavior

**Contingency:**
- Manual cache invalidation on save
- Periodic cache refresh (stale time: 5 minutes)
- Sync mechanism between page and modal components

---

### Risk 4: Complex interactions not keyboard accessible

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High

**Description:**
Modal dialogues, tooltips, and complex interactions might not work correctly with keyboard navigation, violating WCAG AA requirements.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Use Radix UI primitives (built-in keyboard accessibility)
- Comprehensive keyboard testing during development
- Automated testing with axe-core in CI
- Manual testing with screen readers
- Focus management explicit in code

**Contingency:**
- Custom focus trap implementation
- Keyboard event handlers for common shortcuts
- ARIA attributes for complex interactions

---

## User Experience Risks

### Risk 5: Users confused by auto-close behavior

**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Low

**Description:**
Users might be startled or confused when the modal automatically closes after creation, thinking something went wrong.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Clear success toast message: "Listing created successfully"
- Highlight new item in list with animation
- User testing before launch with representative users
- Option to disable auto-close in user settings (future enhancement)
- Documentation and help text

**Contingency:**
- Add visual feedback before close (2-second delay with animation)
- Implement "undo" button if user didn't see the listing
- Add analytics tracking to monitor user behavior

---

### Risk 6: Detail page too information-dense

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

**Description:**
The comprehensive detail page with multiple tabs and sections could overwhelm users or cause information overload.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Tabbed organization to break content into chunks
- Progressive disclosure (show essential info first, details on demand)
- User testing for information hierarchy
- Responsive design with simplified mobile layout
- Clear visual hierarchy with sizing and spacing

**Contingency:**
- Hide less critical sections by default
- Collapsible sections for detailed specs
- Simplified mobile layout variant
- Add search/filter for specifications tab

---

### Risk 7: Mobile experience cramped with complex layouts

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High

**Description:**
Mobile screens (375px-767px) might struggle to display the hero section, summary cards, and tabs in a usable way.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Mobile-first design approach during development
- Responsive testing on real devices (iPhone, Android)
- Simplified mobile layout variants (stacked cards, collapsed sections)
- Touch-friendly controls (44×44 minimum touch targets)
- Horizontal scrolling for summary cards on small screens (if needed)

**Contingency:**
- Reduce visible cards on mobile (show 1-2, swipe for others)
- Collapse specifications into accordion sections
- Full-width tabs with less padding
- Simplified hero section on mobile

---

## Data Risks

### Risk 8: Missing entity relationships break tooltips

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Low

**Description:**
If CPU, GPU, or other entity relationships are missing from the database, tooltips could fail or show incomplete data.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Graceful degradation (hide tooltip if no data available)
- Defensive null checks throughout codebase
- Clear fallback states ("Data unavailable", etc.)
- Optional tooltips (can disable if problematic)
- Data validation in backend API

**Contingency:**
- Fallback text instead of tooltip: "Data not available"
- Show entity name only without tooltip
- Log missing data for backend investigation
- Batch data population script to fix missing relationships

---

### Risk 9: Circular references in attributes JSON

**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium

**Description:**
Circular references in custom field attributes could cause JSON serialization errors or infinite loops.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- JSON stringify with error handling
- Max depth limit for nested objects (2-3 levels)
- Schema validation on backend before returning
- Sanitization of attributes before rendering
- Type validation in TypeScript

**Contingency:**
- Skip problematic attributes silently
- Render attributes as raw JSON in fallback
- Alert user about data corruption
- Backend cleanup script for invalid data

---

## Accessibility Risks

### Risk 10: Color-only indicators fail accessibility

**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** High

**Description:**
Using color alone to indicate adjustment type (green/red for savings/premiums) violates WCAG AA guidelines for colorblind users.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Always pair color with icons (✓ for savings, ⚠ for premiums)
- Add text labels ("Savings", "Premium", "No change")
- Include pattern/texture with colors (optional)
- Contrast ratio verification: ≥ 4.5:1
- Colorblind simulation testing

**Contingency:**
- Add text annotations to all color-coded values
- Use high-contrast color schemes
- Support dark mode with adjusted colors
- Provide legend for color meanings
