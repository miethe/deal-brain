## Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for a comprehensive enhancement of the Listings detail page and modal experiences in Deal Brain. The project addresses four key improvement areas: automatic modal closure after successful creation, intelligent valuation rule filtering, enhanced valuation breakdown displays, and a complete redesign of the detail page to provide a rich, comprehensive view of listing information.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**

1. **Manual Modal Dismissal:** After creating a new listing, users must manually close the creation modal before seeing their new entry in the list view, creating an unnecessary extra step
2. **Visual Clutter in Valuation Tab:** The valuation tab in the listing modal shows all rules (including those with zero contribution), making it difficult to identify which rules actually affected the price
3. **Limited Valuation Breakdown:** The full valuation breakdown screen doesn't clearly separate active contributors from inactive rules, lacks organizational context (RuleGroup/Ruleset labels), and doesn't provide navigation to rule details
4. **Basic Detail Page:** The dedicated detail page at `/listings/[id]` is minimal and doesn't leverage available rich data, including product images, entity relationships, full specifications, or interactive elements

**Business Impact:**

- Reduced workflow efficiency due to manual modal management
- Decreased ability to understand pricing adjustments quickly
- Missed opportunities to surface valuable product information
- Lower user engagement with listing details

### 1.3 Goals

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Streamlined Creation Workflow:** Auto-close creation modal and show new listing immediately
2. **Smart Valuation Display:** Show only relevant rules in modal, with clear visual hierarchy for contributors
3. **Comprehensive Breakdown View:** Provide complete rule visibility with organizational context and navigation
4. **Rich Detail Page:** Transform basic detail page into a comprehensive, visually appealing product showcase

**Secondary Goals:**

- Maintain WCAG AA accessibility compliance across all enhanced components
- Preserve existing performance optimizations (memoization, React Query caching)
- Ensure responsive design for all viewport sizes
- Create reusable patterns for entity detail displays (applicable to CPU, GPU, etc.)

### 1.4 Success Metrics

See [Success Metrics Documentation](./success-metrics.md)

### 1.5 Scope

**In Scope:**

- Auto-close creation modal with list refresh and new item highlight
- Smart rule filtering in modal valuation tab (max 4 contributors, hide zero-impact)
- Enhanced valuation breakdown modal with sorting and navigation
- Complete detail page redesign with tabbed layout
- Product image display (from URL or icon fallback)
- Clickable entity relationships with hover tooltips
- Summary cards with key specifications
- Valuation tab matching modal layout

**Out of Scope:**

- Listing editing from detail page (remains in table/grid views)
- Bulk listing operations from detail page
- Comparison features (multi-listing comparison)
- Price history tracking/visualization
- Seller profile pages
- Review/rating system
- GPU detail tooltips (separate PRD)

## Feature Requirements Overview

This PRD covers four major features. Detailed requirements for each are documented in separate files:

1. **Auto-Close Creation Modal** → See [Feature: Auto-Close Modal](./requirements/auto-close-modal.md)
   - Modal automatically closes after successful listing creation
   - List automatically refreshes with new listing highlighted
   - Success confirmation with toast notification

2. **Smart Rule Display** → See [Feature: Smart Rule Display](./requirements/smart-rule-display.md)
   - Valuation tab shows maximum 4 contributing rules
   - Clear visual hierarchy based on adjustment impact
   - "View Full Breakdown" button for access to all rules

3. **Enhanced Valuation Breakdown** → See [Feature: Enhanced Valuation Breakdown](./requirements/enhanced-breakdown.md)
   - Rules organized into "Active Contributors" and "Inactive Rules" sections
   - RuleGroup labels for organizational context
   - Clickable rule names for navigation to rule details
   - Collapsible inactive section for space optimization

4. **Rich Detail Page** → See [Feature: Rich Detail Page](./requirements/detail-page.md)
   - Comprehensive layout with hero section, product image, and summary cards
   - Tabbed interface: Specifications, Valuation, History, Notes
   - Entity links with hover tooltips for CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage
   - Responsive design across all screen sizes

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** < 200ms for detail page
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** < 1.5 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** < 2.5 seconds
- **Modal open time:** < 100ms (cached data)
- **Valuation breakdown load:** < 500ms (API call)

**Optimization Strategies:**

- Server-side render detail page (Next.js App Router)
- Prefetch related entities during initial load
- Memoize expensive computations (rule sorting, filtering)
- React Query caching with 5-minute stale time
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting for tabs (lazy load content)

See [Performance & Optimization](./design/performance.md) for detailed strategies.

### Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG AA Compliance:**

- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements accessible via Tab, visible focus indicators, modal focus trap
- **Screen Reader Support:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, live regions for dynamic content, alt text for images
- **Visual Accessibility:** Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1, color + icons for information, resizable text, 44×44 touch targets

See [Accessibility Guidelines](./design/accessibility.md) for detailed requirements.

### Security & Compatibility

See [Technical Requirements](./requirements/technical.md) for:
- Authorization and input validation
- Browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile)
- Screen size support (375px - 1920px+)
- Scalability requirements

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative Metrics:**

- Creation modal auto-close success rate: 100%
- Time to see newly created listing: < 2 seconds
- Valuation tab rule count reduction: 50-75%
- Detail page engagement rate: > 40% increase in time spent on detail pages
- Entity link click-through rate: > 25%
- Valuation breakdown modal open rate: > 35%

**Qualitative Metrics:**
