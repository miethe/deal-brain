## Work Log

### 2025-10-23 - Session 1

**Analysis:**

- Reviewed existing ListingValuationTab implementation
- Found that MOST Phase 2 requirements were already implemented in Phase 1 work
- Identified missing requirement: sorting by absolute adjustment amount

**Completed:**

- TASK-201: Added memoized sorting logic for adjustments
  - Filters out zero-value adjustments
  - Sorts by absolute adjustment amount (descending)
  - Uses rule name alphabetically as tiebreaker
  - Implemented with useMemo for performance

**Subagents Used:**

- @lead-architect - Orchestrated implementation approach
- @frontend-developer - Implemented sorting logic (delegated by lead-architect)

- b69a84a feat(web): add sorting to valuation tab rule display

**Blockers/Issues:**

- None

**Next Steps:**

- Phase complete - ready for Phase 3

## Decisions Log

- **[2025-10-23]** Most Phase 2 functionality already existed from Phase 1 implementation
- **[2025-10-23]** Only missing piece was sorting - added as memoized hook for performance
