## Measurement Timeline

### Pre-Launch (Baseline)

- [ ] Establish baseline metrics for creation flow (current modal behavior)
- [ ] Measure current valuation tab rule display patterns
- [ ] Record baseline detail page engagement (if currently available)
- [ ] Document existing error rates and performance metrics

### Week 1-2 Post-Launch

- [ ] Verify creation modal auto-close success rate
- [ ] Measure time from save to listing appearance
- [ ] Count visible rules in valuation tab (should decrease)
- [ ] Track breakdown modal open rates
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance (alert on anomalies)

### Week 3-4 Post-Launch

- [ ] Collect user feedback via survey
- [ ] Analyze detail page engagement metrics
- [ ] Track entity link click patterns
- [ ] Review accessibility test results
- [ ] Performance trend analysis (ensure no regression)

### Month 2 Post-Launch

- [ ] Full adoption analysis
- [ ] User satisfaction vs. targets
- [ ] Identify low-performing features for optimization
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Plan optimization based on data
