---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Commits to Remote

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
# On production server
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

This will create:
- 4 performance metric columns
- 4 product metadata columns
- 8 indexes for filtering/sorting

### 3. Import PassMark Benchmark Data

```bash
# Prepare CSV file with PassMark data
# Format: cpu_name,cpu_mark_single,cpu_mark_multi,igpu_model,igpu_mark,tdp_w,release_year

poetry run python scripts/import_passmark_data.py data/passmark_cpus.csv
```

Expected output:
- Progress logging every 10 CPUs
- Summary: "Updated X CPUs with PassMark data"
- List of unmatched CPUs (if any)

### 4. Recalculate Existing Metrics

```bash
poetry run python scripts/recalculate_all_metrics.py
```

Expected output:
- "Updated X listing(s)"
- Should complete in < 15s for 1000 listings

### 5. Seed Sample Data (Optional)

```bash
poetry run python scripts/seed_sample_listings.py
```

Creates 5 sample listings with:
- Full metadata (manufacturer, series, model, form factor)
- Ports data
- Auto-calculated metrics

### 6. Build and Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Verify:
- Listings table displays new columns
- Form includes new metadata fields
- CPU Info Panel loads on selection
- Ports Builder functional

### 7. Verify Deployment

**Backend Checks:**
- [ ] Migrations applied: `poetry run alembic current` shows revision 0013
- [ ] CPU benchmarks populated: Query CPU table for cpu_mark_single
- [ ] Metrics calculated: Query Listing table for dollar_per_cpu_mark_single

**Frontend Checks:**
- [ ] Listings table loads without errors
- [ ] New columns visible ($/CPU Mark Single, $/CPU Mark Multi, Manufacturer, Form Factor, Ports)
- [ ] Form includes all new fields
- [ ] CPU Info Panel appears when CPU selected
- [ ] Ports Builder allows adding/removing ports

**Performance Checks:**
- [ ] Table renders in < 2s for 500 rows
- [ ] API /recalculate-metrics responds in < 500ms
- [ ] No console errors in browser

---

## Monitoring Setup (Post-Deployment)

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **API Performance:**
   - `listing_metric_calculation_duration_seconds` (P95 < 100ms)
   - `http_requests_total{endpoint="/v1/listings/{id}/recalculate-metrics"}` (success rate > 99%)

2. **Usage Metrics:**
   - % listings with CPU assigned
   - % listings with manufacturer/form factor populated
   - % listings with ports data

3. **Error Rates:**
   - `api_errors_total{type="metric_calculation"}` (< 1%)
   - Frontend JS errors (< 0.5%)

### Alerts to Configure

```yaml
# Prometheus alerts
- alert: HighMetricCalculationTime
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(listing_metric_calculation_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 0.5
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "Metric calculation taking >500ms (P95)"

- alert: HighAPIErrorRate
  expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "API error rate >5%"
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

### Quick Rollback (Frontend Only)

```bash
git revert HEAD~9..HEAD  # Revert last 9 commits
cd apps/web && pnpm run build
```

### Full Rollback (Database + Code)

```bash
# Rollback migrations
poetry run alembic downgrade 0011

# Revert code
git revert HEAD~9..HEAD
git push origin main
```

**Note:** Downgrading migrations will **delete** all performance metric and metadata data.
