## Phase 0 ‚Äì Discovery & Alignment
| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inventory current schemas (listing, cpu, gpu, ports_profile, custom attribute usage) | ‚úÖ | Schema review performed while extending ORM models and services (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/models/core.py:251`; `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/listings.py:1`). |
| Audit importer mapping flow and identify UI component reuse opportunities | ‚úÖ | Required to retrofit importer workspace with new modal and state management (`apps/web/components/import/importer-workspace.tsx:1`). |
| Confirm RBAC requirements and audit logging expectations with security | ‚è≥ | No explicit RBAC/audit coordination recorded. |
| Partner with design to scope modal patterns, data grid interactions, navigation adjustments | ‚è≥ | No dedicated design sync captured; current UI work leveraged existing patterns ad hoc. |
| Deliver kickoff brief (success metrics, timeline, dependencies, risks) | ‚è≥ | No kickoff artifact produced. |

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Domain Model & Migrations
| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Define `field_definition` table with expected columns | ‚úÖ | Added `validation_json`, `display_order`, `deleted_at` plus indexes (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/models/core.py:252`; migration `apps/api/alembic/versions/0005_custom_field_enhancements.py:1`). |
| Generate Alembic migration with data backfill for existing attribute keys | ‚úÖ | Added script-driven backfill utility for dev snapshots (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/custom_fields_backfill.py:1`) keeping migrations lightweight per greenfield guidance. |
| Extend ORM models and repositories; expose typed accessors | ‚úÖ | Model exposes `.validation` property and services updated (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/models/core.py:261`; `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/custom_fields.py:34`). |
| Add audit log table/entries for field changes | ‚úÖ | `custom_field_audit_log` table + service hooks (`apps/api/alembic/versions/0006_custom_field_audit.py:1`; `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/custom_fields.py:1`). |
| Unit tests for model constraints and validation helpers | ‚úÖ | Added validation-focused tests (`tests/test_custom_fields_service.py:1`). |

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Backend Services & APIs
| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build FieldDefinition service (CRUD, validation, dependency checks, audit emission) | ‚úÖ | Dependency checks, audit writes, analytics events, and usage summaries implemented (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/custom_fields.py:1`). |
| Expose REST endpoints `/v1/fields`, `/v1/schemas/listings` | ‚úÖ | `/v1/fields` router with CRUD, history, usage plus legacy proxy for compatibility (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/api/fields.py:1`). |

| Implement CPU auto-creation workflow with dedupe heuristics & audit logging | ‚úÖ | Auto-create logic with manufacturer guess + audit (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/imports/service.py:420`). |
| Extend Listings bulk edit API for dynamic fields & multi-row transactions | ‚úÖ | Added `/v1/listings/bulk-update` endpoint and service support (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/api/listings.py:191`; `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/listings.py:120`). |
| Integration tests (fields CRUD, importer field creation, CPU auto-create, bulk edit) | üîÑ | Added async coverage for field guardrails; importer/listings scenarios still pending (`tests/test_custom_fields_integration.py:1`). |

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Field Management Frontend
| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Implement Global Fields tab UI (grid, filters, status chips, usage count) | ‚úÖ | React Table grid with filters, status toggles, usage badges (`apps/web/components/custom-fields/global-fields-table.tsx:1`). |
| Create field create/edit modal wizard with validation preview | ‚úÖ | Multi-step wizard with validation preview and JSON payload review (`apps/web/components/custom-fields/global-fields-table.tsx:347`). |

| Audit log drawer displaying change history | ‚úÖ | Audit drawer backed by `/v1/fields/{id}/history` (`apps/web/components/custom-fields/global-fields-table.tsx:612`). |
| Instrument analytics events for field operations | ‚úÖ | Frontend analytics hooks + backend emission (`apps/web/components/custom-fields/global-fields-table.tsx:212`; `apps/api/dealbrain_api/services/custom_fields.py:72`). |

| Surface auto-created CPU summary in commit confirmation/history | ‚úÖ | Commit response now returns `auto_created_cpus` and UI message surfaces them (`apps/api/dealbrain_api/api/imports.py:212`; `apps/web/components/import/importer-workspace.tsx:329`). |
