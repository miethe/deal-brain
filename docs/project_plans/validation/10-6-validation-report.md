## 3. Gaps Identified

### 3.1 Missing Requirements
**None identified.** All requirements from the original request are covered in both PRD and Implementation Plan.

### 3.2 Incomplete Specifications

#### Minor: Default Modal State Clarity (Item 8)
**Issue:** PRD Section 2.3.1 mentions modal as default but could be more explicit.

**Current PRD Language (line 358):**
> "Default State: Modal overlay with Add Listing form (max-w-4xl)"

**Recommendation:** Already sufficient, but could add:
> "Modal opens in default modal state (not expanded). User must click expand button to enter full-screen mode."

**Impact:** LOW - Implementation Plan makes this crystal clear, so no functional ambiguity.

**Action:** No changes required, but PRD enhancement optional for clarity.

---

### 3.3 Ambiguities Requiring Clarification

#### 1. Data Tab Page Location
**Issue:** Implementation Plan assumes Data Tab exists at specific location but requests confirmation.

**PRD Reference:** Section 2.3.1 mentions "Data Tab (Global Fields page)"
**Implementation Plan Reference:** Lines 732, 1649 mention location needs confirmation

**Recommendation:**
- Verify actual file path for Data Tab
- Update implementation plan with confirmed path
- If Data Tab doesn't exist, document where Add Entry button should be integrated

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects Phase 5 implementation
**Action:** Confirm file path before Phase 5 execution

---

#### 2. Dashboard Component Location
**Issue:** Implementation Plan assumes dashboard-summary.tsx but requests confirmation.

**PRD Reference:** Section 2.4.1 mentions "dashboard"
**Implementation Plan Reference:** Lines 776, 1674 request location confirmation

**Recommendation:**
- Verify dashboard component file path
- Confirm if dashboard-summary.tsx is correct name
- Document alternative paths if different

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects Phase 5 implementation
**Action:** Confirm file path before Phase 5 execution

---

## 4. Recommendations

### 4.1 Required Additions to PRD
**None.** PRD is comprehensive and covers all requirements.

### 4.2 Optional Enhancements to PRD

#### Enhancement 1: Add Visual Mockups (Low Priority)
**Section:** 8.1 (Appendices)
**Current State:** Section 8.1 notes "To Be Created" for wireframes
**Recommendation:**
- Create simple wireframes for CPU tooltip layout
- Create dashboard modal interaction flow diagram
- Add before/after screenshots for dropdown width improvements

**Benefit:** Visual clarity for stakeholders and implementation teams
**Priority:** LOW - Text descriptions are sufficient for implementation

---

#### Enhancement 2: Clarify Feature Flag Strategy (Medium Priority)
**Section:** 7.3 (Rollback Plan)
**Current State:** Feature flags suggested (lines 1080-1084) but not mandated
**Recommendation:**
- Decide if gradual rollout needed for production
- Document feature flag implementation if required
- Add feature flag testing to QA checklist

**Benefit:** Safer production rollout with quick rollback capability
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Depends on production risk tolerance

---

### 4.3 Required Additions to Implementation Plan
**None.** Implementation Plan is exceptionally detailed and implementation-ready.

### 4.4 Optional Enhancements to Implementation Plan

#### Enhancement 1: Add Time Estimates per Task
**Current State:** Phase durations provided but not task-level estimates
**Recommendation:**
- Add hour estimates for each numbered task in phases
- Help with sprint planning and resource allocation
- Example: "Task 1.2: Check listings API (1 hour)"

**Benefit:** More accurate sprint planning
**Priority:** LOW - Phase estimates are sufficient

---

#### Enhancement 2: Add Rollback Procedures per Phase
**Current State:** Overall rollback plan in PRD Section 7.3
**Recommendation:**
- Add rollback steps after each phase validation checkpoint
- Specify what to revert if phase validation fails
- Document database rollback steps if migrations added

**Benefit:** Faster recovery from phase-level issues
**Priority:** LOW - Overall rollback plan is sufficient

---

### 4.5 Suggested Clarifications

#### Clarification 1: Resolve File Path Ambiguities
**Action Items:**
1. Run `find` command to locate Data Tab page component
2. Run `find` command to locate dashboard summary component
3. Update Implementation Plan Section 11.4 with confirmed paths
4. Add confirmation to validation checkpoints

**Commands to Run:**
```bash
find /mnt/containers/deal-brain/apps/web -name "*data*page*" -o -name "*global-fields*"
find /mnt/containers/deal-brain/apps/web -name "*dashboard*summary*"
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Required before Phase 5
**Timeline:** Before Phase 5 kickoff

---

#### Clarification 2: Confirm No Database Migrations Needed
**Current State:** PRD Section 3.3 states "No migrations required"
**Action Items:**
1. Verify `dollar_per_cpu_mark_single` column exists in listing table
2. Verify `dollar_per_cpu_mark_multi` column exists in listing table
3. Verify `secondary_storage_gb` column exists and is Integer type
4. Verify Port model has `ports_profile_id` field (not `port_profile_id`)

**SQL Verification Commands:**
```sql
\d listing  -- Check for CPU Mark columns and secondary_storage_gb
\d port     -- Check for ports_profile_id field
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Required before Phase 1
**Timeline:** Immediately before implementation starts

## 6. Implementation Readiness

### 6.1 Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Confirm Database Schema:** Verify all columns exist (CPU Mark metrics, secondary_storage_gb)
- [ ] **Confirm Port Model:** Verify field is `ports_profile_id` not `port_profile_id`
- [ ] **Locate Data Tab:** Find actual file path for Global Fields / Data Tab page
- [ ] **Locate Dashboard:** Find actual file path for dashboard summary component
- [ ] **Review Dependencies:** Ensure all libraries in package.json (Radix UI, TanStack, React Query)
- [ ] **Setup Test Environment:** Prepare clean database for seed script testing
- [ ] **Stakeholder Approval:** Get sign-off on PRD from product and design teams

### 6.2 Risk Assessment
**Overall Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Risks Identified:**
1. **Column Resizing Restoration (MEDIUM):** May require debugging TanStack Table configuration
   - **Mitigation:** Phase 2 includes detailed troubleshooting steps
2. **CPU Data API Response (MEDIUM):** CPU data may not be included in listings response
   - **Mitigation:** Phase 3 includes verification and fallback approach
3. **File Path Ambiguities (LOW):** Data Tab and Dashboard locations need confirmation
   - **Mitigation:** Quick file search will resolve before Phase 5

**No High-Risk Items Identified**
