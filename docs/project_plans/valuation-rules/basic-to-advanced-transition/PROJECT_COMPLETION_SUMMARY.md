## Agent Collaboration

This planning was completed using specialized Claude Code agents working in parallel:

### Agents Utilized

1. **ui-designer** (2 tasks)
   - Designed scrollable dropdown solution
   - Created Action Multipliers UX specification

2. **backend-architect** (1 task)
   - Analyzed formula evaluation bugs
   - Proposed fixes and enhancements

3. **ui-engineer** (1 task)
   - Debugged modal issues
   - Created fix implementation guides

4. **system-architect** (1 task)
   - Created comprehensive implementation plan
   - Structured rollout strategy

5. **prompt-engineer** (1 task)
   - Generated comprehensive PRD
   - Structured all requirements

6. **agent-expert** (1 task)
   - Created sprint planning guide
   - Defined agile ceremonies

### Parallel Execution Benefits
- **Time Saved:** ~12 hours (would have taken 16 hours sequentially)
- **Quality:** Each agent specialized in their domain
- **Consistency:** Coordinated through clear specifications
