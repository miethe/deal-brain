# Implementation Guide: Modal Bug Fixes

**Quick Reference for Developers**

---

## Summary

Fix two critical modal bugs in Valuation Rules:
1. Wrong modal opens when clicking "Add Rule Group" in empty state
2. Newly created RuleGroups don't appear until manual refresh

**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes implementation + 20 minutes testing = 50 minutes total

---

## Bug 1: Wrong Modal Opens (CRITICAL)

### Location
File: `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/apps/web/app/valuation-rules/page.tsx`
Lines: 698-705

### The Fix
```tsx
// BEFORE (Lines 698-705)
<Button
  variant="outline"
  className="mt-4"
  onClick={() => setIsRulesetBuilderOpen(true)}  // ❌ WRONG
>
  <Plus className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Add Rule Group
</Button>

// AFTER (Replace with)
<Button
  variant="outline"
  className="mt-4"
  onClick={() => {
    setEditingGroup(null);
    setIsGroupFormOpen(true);  // ✅ CORRECT
  }}
>
  <Plus className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Add Rule Group
</Button>
```

### Test
1. Create new Ruleset → Click "Add Rule Group" in empty state → Verify RuleGroupFormModal opens
2. Delete all RuleGroups → Verify empty state button still opens correct modal

---

## Bug 2: New Items Don't Appear (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Root Cause
Modal closes before React Query finishes refetching data, causing UI to show stale data.

### Solution
Reorder operations in `onSuccess` handlers to wait for cache invalidation before closing modal.

### Fix 2A: RuleGroupFormModal

**File:** `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/apps/web/components/valuation/rule-group-form-modal.tsx`
**Lines:** 82-124

```tsx
// BEFORE (Lines 82-124)
const saveMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: () => {
    if (isEditing && ruleGroup) {
      return updateRuleGroup(ruleGroup.id, {
        name,
        description,
        category,
        display_order: displayOrder,
        weight,
        is_active: isActive,
      });
    }
    return createRuleGroup({
      ruleset_id: rulesetId,
      name,
      description,
      category,
      display_order: displayOrder,
      weight,
      is_active: isActive,
    });
  },
  onSuccess: () => {
    toast({
      title: isEditing ? "Rule group updated" : "Rule group created",
      description: isEditing
        ? "The rule group has been updated successfully"
        : "The rule group has been created successfully",
    });
    resetForm();
    onOpenChange(false);  // ❌ Closes too early
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["ruleset", rulesetId] });
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["rulesets"] });
    onSuccess();
  },
  onError: (error: Error) => {
    toast({
      title: "Error",
      description: error.message,
      variant: "destructive",
    });
  },
});

// AFTER (Replace onSuccess with)
const saveMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: () => {
    if (isEditing && ruleGroup) {
      return updateRuleGroup(ruleGroup.id, {
        name,
        description,
        category,
        display_order: displayOrder,
        weight,
        is_active: isActive,
      });
    }
    return createRuleGroup({
      ruleset_id: rulesetId,
      name,
      description,
      category,
      display_order: displayOrder,
      weight,
      is_active: isActive,
    });
  },
  onSuccess: async () => {  // ✅ Make async
    toast({
      title: isEditing ? "Rule group updated" : "Rule group created",
      description: isEditing
        ? "The rule group has been updated successfully"
        : "The rule group has been created successfully",
    });

    // ✅ Invalidate and wait for refetch
    await Promise.all([
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["ruleset", rulesetId] }),
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["rulesets"] }),
    ]);

    // ✅ Call parent refresh
    onSuccess();

    // ✅ Close modal AFTER data is refreshed
    resetForm();
    onOpenChange(false);
  },
  onError: (error: Error) => {
    toast({
      title: "Error",
      description: error.message,
      variant: "destructive",
    });
  },
});
```

### Fix 2B: RulesetBuilderModal

**File:** `/mnt/containers/deal-brain/apps/web/components/valuation/ruleset-builder-modal.tsx`
**Lines:** 39-64

```tsx
// BEFORE (Lines 39-64)

    createRuleset({
      name,
      description,
      version,
      priority,
      is_active: isActive,
    }),

      title: "Ruleset created",
      description: "The ruleset has been created successfully",
    });
    resetForm();
    onOpenChange(false);  // ❌ Closes too early
    onSuccess();
  },

  onSuccess: async () => {  // ✅ Make async
    toast({
      title: "Ruleset created",
      description: "The ruleset has been created successfully",
    });

    // ✅ Wait for parent to handle refresh
    await onSuccess();

    // ✅ Close modal AFTER refresh
    resetForm();
    onOpenChange(false);
  },
  onError: (error: Error) => {
    toast({
      title: "Error",
      description: error.message,
      variant: "destructive",
    });
  },

  });
  track(isEditing ? "valuation_rule.updated" : "valuation_rule.created", {
    rule_id: savedRule.id,
    group_id: savedRule.group_id,
    conditions: savedRule.conditions?.length ?? 0,
    actions: savedRule.actions?.length ?? 0,
  });
  resetForm();
  onOpenChange(false);  // ❌ Closes too early
  onSuccess();
},

// AFTER (Replace with)
onSuccess: async (savedRule) => {  // ✅ Make async

## Testing Checklist

### Smoke Tests (Must Pass)
- [ ] **Bug 1:** Empty state "Add Rule Group" button opens RuleGroupFormModal (not RulesetBuilderModal)
- [ ] **Bug 2:** Create new RuleGroup → Appears immediately in list
- [ ] **Bug 2:** Create new Ruleset → Appears immediately in dropdown
- [ ] **Bug 2:** Create new Rule → Appears immediately in group

### Regression Tests
- [ ] "New Ruleset" button opens RulesetBuilderModal
- [ ] "Add Group" button (top-right) opens RuleGroupFormModal
- [ ] "Add Rule" button opens RuleBuilderModal
- [ ] Edit RuleGroup → Changes appear immediately
- [ ] Edit Rule → Changes appear immediately

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Create RuleGroup with slow network (throttle to Slow 3G in DevTools)
- [ ] Create multiple RuleGroups rapidly (click Add Group 3x quickly)
- [ ] Create RuleGroup with invalid data → Modal stays open, shows error

### Accessibility
- [ ] Press Escape key → Modal closes
- [ ] Tab through form → Focus order is logical
- [ ] Submit with Enter key → Form submits

## Git Commit Message

```
fix(valuation-rules): Fix modal bugs for RuleGroup creation

Fixes two critical UX bugs in Advanced mode:

1. Wrong modal opens when clicking "Add Rule Group" in empty state
   - Changed onClick handler to open RuleGroupFormModal instead of RulesetBuilderModal

2. Newly created items don't appear until manual refresh
   - Made mutation onSuccess handlers async
   - Wait for React Query to complete cache invalidation before closing modals
   - Applied fix to RuleGroupFormModal, RulesetBuilderModal, and RuleBuilderModal

Tested:
- Empty state flow works correctly
- New items appear immediately after creation
- Edit flows work as expected
- Rapid creation handled correctly
- Error handling preserved

## Additional Notes

### Why This Works
React Query's `invalidateQueries()` triggers a refetch but doesn't wait for it to complete. By making `onSuccess` async and using `await Promise.all()`, we ensure the refetch completes before closing the modal.

### Alternative Solution (If Issues Persist)
If the async/await approach causes problems, use a small delay:

```tsx
onSuccess: () => {
  toast({ ... });
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ ... });
  onSuccess();

  // Close after 100ms delay
  setTimeout(() => {
    resetForm();
    onOpenChange(false);
  }, 100);
},
```

### TypeScript Note
The `onSuccess` callback in `@tanstack/react-query` v4/v5 supports async handlers, so making it async is safe and supported.
