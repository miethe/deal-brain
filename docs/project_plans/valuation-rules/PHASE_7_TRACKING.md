# Phase 7 Implementation Tracking

**Date Started:** October 2, 2025
**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress
**Project:** UI/UX Enhancements - Multi-Pane Layout & Static Navigation

---

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of Phase 7 of the UI/UX Enhancements project, focusing on optimizing page layouts with resizable panes and static navigation elements.

**Phase 7:** Multi-Pane Layout & Static Nav (2-3 sessions)

---

## Phase 7: Multi-Pane Layout & Static Nav

### 7.1 Resizable Pane System âœ…

**Goal:** Create reusable resizable pane component for multi-table layouts

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `ResizablePane` component
- [x] Add mouse event handlers for resize
- [x] Add localStorage persistence for heights
- [x] Add visual resize handle
- [x] Add min/max height constraints
- [x] Test resize behavior
- [ ] Add tests (deferred)

**Files:**
- `apps/web/components/ui/resizable-pane.tsx` (new)

**Implementation Details:**
- Mouse drag to resize with visual feedback
- Persist height per pane ID in localStorage
- Constrained resizing (min: 300px, max: 800px default)
- Bottom border resize handle with hover states

---

### 7.2 Static Sidebar & Navbar âœ…

**Goal:** Fix navigation elements to viewport for better UX

**Tasks:**
- [x] Update Navbar to fixed positioning (changed from sticky per actual implementation)
- [x] Update Sidebar to fixed positioning
- [x] Adjust main content margin-left for sidebar
- [x] Add responsive mobile behavior (hamburger menu)
- [x] Add mobile overlay
- [x] Test scroll behavior
- [ ] Add tests (deferred)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/components/app-shell.tsx` (navbar and sidebar combined in one component)

**Implementation Details:**
- Navbar: `position: fixed; top: 0; z-index: 100` with backdrop-blur
- Sidebar: `position: fixed; left: 0; top: 14; z-index: 90`
- Main content: `pt-14 lg:ml-64` for proper spacing
- Mobile: Hamburger toggle with X icon, slide-in animation
- Overlay backdrop on mobile when sidebar open (z-80)
- Sidebar auto-closes on mobile after navigation

## Progress Summary

### Phase 7.1: Resizable Pane System
- Status: âœ… Complete
- Completion: 100%

### Phase 7.2: Static Sidebar & Navbar
- Status: âœ… Complete
- Completion: 100%

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- ResizablePane uses mouse events (not touch) - mobile users won't resize
- Pane heights persist per-pane ID in localStorage for consistent UX
- Resize handle at bottom of pane (not between panes) for simpler implementation

### Technical Decisions
- Z-index hierarchy: Modals (200) > Navbar (100) > Sidebar (90) > Content (default)
- Sidebar mobile breakpoint: 1024px (lg: in Tailwind)
- Navbar height: 60px (used for sidebar top offset calculation)

---

## Completion Criteria

- [x] ResizablePane component created and working
- [x] Navbar is fixed and stays visible on scroll
- [x] Sidebar is fixed and doesn't scroll with content
- [x] Mobile responsive behavior works (sidebar collapse)
- [ ] All changes tested in development environment (build passes with minor dep issue)
- [ ] Code committed with comprehensive summary
- [ ] Context document updated
- [ ] Phase 7 completion summary written

## Known Issues

- `@dnd-kit/utilities` package needs to be installed (added to package.json but installation blocked by permission issues)
- This package was introduced in Phase 4 for dropdown-options-builder, not Phase 7
- The ResizablePane and AppShell changes in Phase 7 build successfully
- Badge component was enhanced to support variant prop to fix TypeScript errors from earlier phases
