Tasks

Per the attached PRD @prd, create the Implementation Plan to fully implement the requests. Your output should be markdown artifacts - the Implementation Plan for the PRD - created within a dir specific to these efforts (which you should also create if not already) in /docs/project_plans/ (`basic-valuation-enhance/` already created). Remember that you should avoid pseudocode or overly prescriptive instructions, focusing more on the design and overall guidance for the dev team on the tasks to be completed.

Utilize the Valuation Rules System Architecture at [valuation-rules.md](docs/architecture/valuation-rules.md) . Once finished, commit your changes to git. Utilize the attached context file as needed [ui-enhancements-context.md](.claude/progress/ui-enhancements-context.md)
