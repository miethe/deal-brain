## Issue Summary

**Issue 1: Progress Bar Cosmetic - Not Reflecting Real Status**
- **Problem:** Progress bar never completes, shows cosmetic animation not tied to backend status
- **Recent Fix Attempt:** Commit f44dea3 tried to fix but issue persists
- **Root Cause:** Progress calculation is time-based (cosmetic) rather than status-based (real)

**Issue 2: Incomplete Field Population**
- **Problem:** Only title, price, condition populated; missing image URLs, description, brand, model, specs
- **Impact:** Listings lack critical data available in source URLs
- **Root Cause:** Adapters extract data but don't populate all available fields

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Progress Bar Analysis

**Current Implementation Review:**

1. **Frontend (`ingestion-status-display.tsx`):**
   - Line 202-215: `calculateProgress()` uses elapsed time, not job status
   - Returns 15-98% based on time brackets (0-5s, 5-15s, 15-30s, >30s)
   - Never reaches 100% during polling state
   - Completion animation (100%) only shows briefly on status change

2. **Polling Hook (`use-ingestion-job.ts`):**
   - Lines 29-38: `refetchInterval` properly stops on complete/failed/partial
   - Lines 33: Checks `data.status` correctly
   - Polling stops when status is terminal

3. **Backend Status Updates (`tasks/ingestion.py`):**
   - Lines 56-57: Sets status to "running" immediately
   - Lines 67: Sets status to "complete" or "partial" on success
   - Lines 78: Sets status to "failed" on error
   - Line 83: Commits transaction with status

4. **Status Response (`api/ingestion.py`):**
   - GET `/api/v1/ingest/{job_id}` endpoint returns ImportSession
   - Response includes `status`, `result`, `error` fields
   - Frontend polls this endpoint every 2 seconds

**The Real Issue:**
- Progress bar calculation is **time-based** (cosmetic simulation)
- Should be **status-based** (reflecting actual backend progress)
- Backend doesn't expose granular progress (queued → running → complete)
- Frontend calculates progress from elapsed time, not job status

**Technical Debt from Commit f44dea3:**
- Added completion animation (lines 32-39, 112-140)
- Fixed transition to 100% but only AFTER status changes to complete
- Did NOT fix the core issue: progress during polling is still cosmetic

### Issue 2: Field Population Analysis

**Current Adapter Implementation:**

1. **EbayAdapter (`adapters/ebay.py`):**
   - Lines 303-348: Maps eBay API response to NormalizedListingSchema
   - Line 329-332: Extracts primary image from `image.imageUrl`
   - Line 347: Extracts description from `shortDescription` or `description`
   - Line 349+: Extracts specs from `localizedAspects`
   - **Extracts:** title, price, condition, images, seller, vendor_item_id, description, CPU/RAM/storage from specs

2. **JsonLdAdapter (`adapters/jsonld.py`):**
   - Lines 334-440: Maps Schema.org Product to NormalizedListingSchema
   - Line 420: Extracts images via `_extract_images()`
   - Line 423: Extracts description from product.description
   - Line 426: Parses specs from description or title
   - **Extracts:** title, price, condition, images, seller, description, CPU/RAM/storage from text

3. **ListingNormalizer (`services/ingestion.py`):**
   - Lines 400-418: Enriches raw data with currency conversion, CPU canonicalization
   - Copies fields from raw_data to enriched schema
   - Does NOT parse brand/model from title
   - Does NOT sanitize/normalize fields beyond currency/condition

**The Real Issue:**
- Adapters ARE extracting images and descriptions
- Data IS being populated in NormalizedListingSchema
- Problem is likely in **ListingsService.upsert_from_url()** or **database mapping**
- Need to check if fields are being persisted to Listing model

## Technical Decisions

### TD-FIX-001: Progress Tracking Approach
**Decision:** Add `progress_pct` field to ImportSession, update at key milestones
**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Keep time-based estimation (rejected: not accurate)
2. Add separate ProgressTracking table (rejected: over-engineered)
3. Use Celery task state for progress (rejected: requires Celery result backend)

**Rationale:**
- Simple, direct approach using existing ImportSession model
- Backward compatible (nullable field with default)
- No additional infrastructure required
- Easy to query and display in UI

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires database migration (low risk)
- Progress updates require session.flush() (minor performance impact)
- Not real-time (updated at milestones only, not continuously)

### TD-FIX-002: Brand/Model Parsing Strategy
**Decision:** Regex-based parsing with common patterns, fallback to None
**Alternatives Considered:**
1. ML-based parsing with NER model (rejected: complex, overkill)
2. External API for brand detection (rejected: latency, cost)
3. Manual mapping table (rejected: unmaintainable)

**Rationale:**
- Simple, fast, no external dependencies
- Covers 80%+ of common formats
- Fails gracefully (None if no match)
- Can be enhanced incrementally

**Patterns to Support:**
- "{Brand} {Model} {specs}" (e.g., "MINISFORUM Venus NAB9 Mini PC...")
- "{Brand} {Series}-{Model}" (e.g., "Dell OptiPlex-7090")
- "{Model} by {Brand}" (e.g., "Venus NAB9 by MINISFORUM")

### TD-FIX-003: Field Sanitization Rules
**Decision:** Normalize at adapter level, validate at service level
**Sanitization Rules:**
- **Prices:** Strip currency symbols, convert to Decimal, validate > 0
- **Conditions:** Map to enum (new|refurb|used), default to "used"
- **Text fields:** Strip whitespace, truncate to max length, remove control chars
- **URLs:** Validate format, ensure HTTPS where possible

**Rationale:**
- Adapters handle source-specific quirks
- Services enforce business rules
- Separation of concerns (extraction vs validation)

---

## Success Criteria

### Issue 1: Progress Bar
- [ ] Progress bar reaches 100% on successful import
- [ ] Progress bar stops at failure point on error
- [ ] Progress updates reflect real backend status
- [ ] No cosmetic time-based estimation during polling
- [ ] Completion animation plays smoothly
- [ ] Toast notifications appear correctly

### Issue 2: Field Population
- [ ] All listings have title, price, condition, image_url (100%)
- [ ] Most listings have description (>80%)
- [ ] Common brands/models parsed from titles (>70%)
- [ ] CPU/RAM/storage populated when available (>60%)
- [ ] No data loss from adapter extraction to database
- [ ] Existing imports not affected (backward compatible)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Migration conflicts:** Adding progress_pct field may conflict with concurrent migrations
  - **Mitigation:** Check for pending migrations before creating new one
- **Performance impact:** Multiple session.flush() calls during import
  - **Mitigation:** Benchmark import latency before/after changes

### Medium Risk
- **Brand/model parsing false positives:** Regex may incorrectly identify brand
  - **Mitigation:** Conservative patterns, manual review of common cases
- **Field mapping errors:** Incorrect field mapping may cause data loss
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing with real URLs

### Low Risk
- **Frontend progress bar flicker:** UI updates may cause visual glitches
  - **Mitigation:** Use smooth CSS transitions, test on slow connections
- **Documentation drift:** Docs may become outdated
  - **Mitigation:** Update docs as part of PR process

## Notes & Learnings

### 2025-10-22: Initial Analysis
- Commit f44dea3 addressed UI symptoms but not root cause
- Progress bar calculation is time-based, not status-based
- Backend doesn't expose granular progress (just queued/running/complete)
- Need to add progress_pct field to ImportSession for real tracking

### Investigation Findings (2025-10-22: Phase 1 Complete)

**Issue 1: Progress Bar**
- ✅ Confirmed: Frontend uses time-based `calculateProgress(elapsed)` function
- ✅ Confirmed: Backend has NO `progress_pct` field on ImportSession model
- ✅ Confirmed: Only 3 status states (queued → running → complete/failed)
- ✅ Root cause: No granular progress tracking in backend, frontend simulates progress

**Issue 2: Field Population**
- ✅ Confirmed: NormalizedListingSchema HAS `images`, `description` fields
- ✅ Confirmed: Listing model LACKS `image_url`, `description` fields
- ✅ Confirmed: IngestionService._create_listing() only maps subset of fields
- ✅ Root cause: Missing database fields + incomplete field mapping

**Key Findings:**
- Adapters ARE extracting data correctly (images, description, specs)
- Data is NOT persisting because Listing model lacks fields
- manufacturer/model_number fields exist but are not populated
- Raw data IS preserved in RawPayload table (can backfill if needed)
