# Listings Catalog Views - User Guide

## Overview

The Listings Catalog View provides three specialized interfaces for browsing, comparing, and managing PC listings. Each view is optimized for different workflows, allowing you to choose the best interface for your current task.

### Available Views

1. **Grid View** - Visual discovery mode with cards showing key metrics at a glance
2. **Dense List View** - High-density table for bulk operations and quick scanning
3. **Master/Detail View** - Split layout for detailed comparison with context

All views share the same powerful filtering system and preserve your preferences across sessions.

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right View

**Use Grid View when:**
- Browsing new listings for the first time
- Visual scanning is more important than detailed metrics
- Working on mobile or tablet
- Color-coded value indicators are helpful

**Use Dense List View when:**

- Comparing metrics across many listings
- Working with keyboard-heavy workflows
- Information density is paramount

**Use Master/Detail View when:**
- Evaluating multiple specific listings (comparison)
- Need detailed specs without losing context
- Using keyboard shortcuts (j/k/c navigation)
- Comparing up to 6 listings side-by-side

### Filtering Strategies

**Finding Great Deals:**
1. Set price range to your budget
2. Filter by desired form factor (e.g., Mini-PC)
3. Search for preferred CPU (e.g., "i7")
4. Sort automatically shows best value first
5. Look for dark emerald adjusted prices (>15% savings)

**Comparing Similar Devices:**
1. Use Master/Detail view
2. Filter to narrow results (manufacturer, form factor)
3. Select interesting listings with compare checkbox
4. Open compare drawer to see side-by-side
5. Evaluate $/MT and adjusted prices

**Bulk Editing:**
1. Switch to Dense List View
2. Apply filters to target specific listings
3. Use shift+click for range selection
4. Click "Bulk Edit" in selection panel
